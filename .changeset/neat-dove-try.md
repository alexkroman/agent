Studio scope unification and workspace source sync: raw API keys stored via the account route reverse-map to the owning studio user (`key-user:<sha256(key)>`), so a linked CLI shares the browser's project scope; new `PUT /studio/projects/:project/source` replaces a workspace's file map atomically with a files-hash fast-forward token (`sourceHash` now returned by project GET/SSE payloads); deleting a studio project cascades to its deployed and preview agents through the shared `deleteAgentResources` core, ownership-gated per slug.
