# CLAUDE.md

## Overview

AAI is a voice agent development kit. Users define agents as directories
containing `agent.ts`. The CLI bundles and deploys them to the managed platform.

- **Platform**: `agent.ts` → CLI bundle → deploy to managed server

## Commands

```sh
pnpm install             # Install dependencies
pnpm test                # Run all unit tests (vitest)
pnpm lint                # Run Biome linter (all packages)
pnpm typecheck           # Type-check all packages
pnpm lint:fix            # Auto-fix lint issues
pnpm check:local         # Fast pre-commit gate (single turbo invocation, max parallelism)
pnpm check:affected      # Only check packages affected by changes since main
```

### Test tiers

| Tier | Command | Scope | Timeout |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Unit | `pnpm test` | Fast, mocked, co-located | 5s |
| Integration | `pnpm test:integration` | Real subsystems (HTTP servers, WebSockets) | 30s |
| E2E | `pnpm test:e2e` | Full process spawn + Playwright browser | 300s |
| Templates | `pnpm test:templates` | Template agent example tests | 5s |

### Single-package shortcuts

```sh
pnpm test:aai-core       # Run only aai unit tests
pnpm test:aai-ui         # Run only aai-ui unit tests
pnpm test:aai-cli        # Run only aai-cli unit tests
pnpm test:aai-server     # Run only aai-server unit tests
pnpm test:aai-studio-client  # Run studio front-end unit tests
pnpm test:templates      # Run template agent tests
pnpm dev:aai-server      # Start aai-server in dev mode
```

### Running specific tests

```sh
pnpm vitest run --project aai                   # Single package via --project
pnpm vitest run packages/aai/types.test.ts      # Single file
pnpm vitest run session                         # All files matching "session"
pnpm --filter @alexkroman1/aai test             # Single package via pnpm filter
```

### Full CI check (`pnpm check`)

Runs via `scripts/check.sh` in a single turbo invocation for maximum
parallelism. Turbo handles the dependency graph — tasks with no
dependencies (lint, test, syncpack, sherif) start immediately while
build-dependent tasks (typecheck, publint, attw) wait for build.

Turbo runs tasks in **strict env mode**, so proxy/CA variables
(`HTTPS_PROXY`, `NO_PROXY`, `NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS`, …) are listed in
`globalPassThroughEnv` in `turbo.json` — passed through to tasks but kept
out of cache hashes. Without this, any task that makes real network calls
(the e2e suite's verdaccio→npmjs uplink) silently loses its egress config
in proxied environments and fails with misleading errors (instant
`ERR_PNPM_FETCH_404`s) that only reproduce under `turbo run`, never when
running the underlying script directly.

`pnpm check:local` uses the same script with `--local` flag, running a
subset: build, typecheck, lint, publint, syncpack, sherif, knip, test —
all in one turbo call with `--continue` (shows all failures at once).

`pnpm check:affected` uses turbo's `--affected` flag to only run tasks
for packages changed since the default branch.

### Quality ratchets

Beyond lint/typecheck/test, `scripts/check.sh` **and the CI check job** run
two **ratchet gates** (both also runnable standalone) that hold the line on
technical debt by comparing the branch against its merge-base with
`origin/main`. They must stay wired into BOTH: for a long time they lived
only in `check.sh`, which CI never invokes, so the only thing enforcing them
was the pre-push hook — and `git push --no-verify` skipped them entirely.

- **`pnpm check:hatches`** (`scripts/check-escape-hatches.mjs`) — counts
  static-analysis escape hatches (`@ts-expect-error`, `@ts-ignore`,
  `@ts-nocheck`, `biome-ignore`, `eslint-disable`, `as any`) across
  `packages/` and fails on any **net-new** total versus the merge base.
  The baseline only ratchets down — removing a hatch lowers the bar for the
  next branch, and you can't silently add one. Fix the underlying
  type/lint error instead of suppressing it.
- **`pnpm check:file-length`** (`scripts/check-file-length.mjs`) — caps
  source files at 500 lines and test files at 700. Files that already
  exceed the cap are grandfathered in `scripts/file-length-allowlist.json`,
  which records each file's current ceiling; a grandfathered file may not
  grow past its ceiling, and ceilings should only ever be lowered as files
  are split up. New files must come in under the cap. Templates under
  `packages/aai-templates/templates/` are exempt.

These are pure git/fs checks (no build needed), so they run up front and
fail fast. To tighten quality over time, lower the entries in the
file-length allowlist and delete escape hatches — both baselines are
designed to only move one direction.

A third ratchet lives in the vitest configs: **coverage thresholds**.
Every package has floors — `aai-templates` was for a while the one that did
not, so CI measured its coverage and threw the number away. Each package's
`vitest.config.ts` declares per-package coverage floors
(lines/functions/branches/statements) that CI enforces via
`pnpm test:coverage` (the `test` job runs it per package), and the root
`vitest.config.ts` holds combined floors for whole-repo runs. Like the
other ratchets these only move up: when a coverage run shows actuals
comfortably above a floor, raise the floor to ~2-3 points below the
actual. Never lower a floor to make a PR pass — add tests instead.
Coverage measures production source only; test infrastructure
(`_test-utils.ts`, mocks, fixtures, setup files) is excluded via
`sharedCoverageExclude` in `vitest.shared.ts`.

## Architecture

Eight workspace packages under `packages/`:

| Package | npm name | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `packages/aai/` | `@alexkroman1/aai` | Shared core: manifest, types, protocol, S2S, session, Db |
| `packages/aai-ui/` | `@alexkroman1/aai-ui` | Browser client (React 19): session, audio, UI components |
| `packages/aai-cli/` | `@alexkroman1/aai-cli` | The `aai` CLI: init, dev, test, build, deploy, delete, secret |
| `packages/aai-guest/` | `aai-guest` | Guest sandbox harness (private): the Node entrypoint that runs the complete agent inside each Modal Sandbox, built into one self-contained `dist/harness.mjs` |
| `packages/aai-server/` | `aai-server` | Agent service + shared platform core (private): sandbox, auth, SSRF, stores, locks/epochs |
| `packages/aai-studio-server/` | `aai-studio-server` | Studio service (private): browser coding agent, workspace builds, combined entry |
| `packages/aai-studio-client/` | `aai-studio-client` | The studio's browser front-end (private): Vite React app served by aai-server |
| `packages/aai-templates/` | `aai-templates` | Agent templates + scaffold (private): starter templates |

**Dependency flow:** `aai-cli`, `aai-ui`, `aai-guest`, and `aai-server` all
depend on `@alexkroman1/aai` (via `workspace:*`). `aai-server` depends on
`aai-guest` only to resolve its built artifact (`aai-guest/harness` →
`dist/harness.mjs`, baked into the guest snapshot image) — it never imports
guest source, and the guest never imports server code; that hard boundary is
the reason the guest is its own package. The one edge to the CLI is
`aai-server` → `aai-cli`, and only for its two public bundler subpaths
(`/worker-bundler`, `/client-bundler`): the studio builds workspaces
through the CLI's own Vite pipeline rather than carrying a second
bundler. Do not widen it — nothing else in the server may import from
the CLI, and the CLI must never import from the server.

**Publishable packages must use the `@alexkroman1/` scope.** The unscoped
names `aai`, `aai-ui`, `aai-cli` are taken on npm by other publishers —
publishing under those names returns 404. The `scripts/check-publish-names.mjs`
script enforces this at CI time.

### Package exports

#### `aai` (shared core SDK)

Subpath exports consumed by sibling packages and user agents:

- `.` — `agent()`, `tool()` helpers, `Db`, types, utils, constants
- `./utils` — zod-free utilities + platform slug contract (fast CLI startup path)
- `./runtime` — full Node.js runtime engine (barrel → 11 host/ modules)
- `./protocol` — wire-format Zod schemas, `lenientParse()`, `ClientEvent`
- `./manifest` — `parseManifest()`, `toAgentConfig()`, `agentToolsToSchemas()`
- `./stt` — pipeline-mode STT provider factories (e.g. `assemblyAI`)
- `./tts` — pipeline-mode TTS provider factories (e.g. `cartesia`)

#### `aai-ui` (UI)

- `.` — default React UI component + session + client helpers
- `./styles.css` — default styles
- `./default-client/*` — prebuilt default client assets (`dist/default-client/`)

#### `aai-cli` (CLI)

Binary: `aai` — subcommands: init, dev, test, build, deploy, delete, secret

### SDK structure

The SDK is organized into two directories with a **hard dependency
boundary** — this split is critical for sandbox security:

- **`sdk/`** — shared modules with **zero Node.js dependencies**. Safe to
  run in browsers, Deno, and sandboxed environments. Contains:
  `types.ts`, `db.ts`, `hooks.ts`, `utils.ts`, `constants.ts`,
  `protocol.ts`, `system-prompt.ts`, `manifest.ts`,
  `ws-upgrade.ts`, `_internal-types.ts`, `define.ts` (`agent()` and
  `tool()` helpers for authoring `agent.ts` files).
- **`host/`** — host-only modules that **require Node.js APIs** (`node:vm`,
  `node:crypto`, etc.). Only runs on the platform server and CLI, never
  inside a guest sandbox. Contains:
  `server.ts`, `runtime.ts`, `runtime-config.ts`, `runtime-types.ts`,
  `runtime-transport.ts` (transport selection/construction for the runtime),
  `tool-executor.ts`, `session-core.ts`, `s2s.ts`, `ws-handler.ts`,
  `transports/` (S2S / pipeline / OpenAI Realtime `Transport`
  implementations, including `pipeline-turn-outcome.ts` — the three ways a
  pipeline turn ends: interrupted by barge-in, failed, or spoken), `to-vercel-tools.ts`,
  `providers/` (STT/TTS openers + descriptor→instance resolvers),
  `builtin-tools.ts`, `postgres-db.ts`.

**Rule**: When adding new SDK code, place it in `sdk/` if it has no
`node:` dependencies. Moving code from `sdk/` → `host/` is safe;
moving `host/` → `sdk/` requires removing all Node.js imports first.

The guest harness (`packages/aai-guest/harness.ts`) runs **Node** inside each Modal
Sandbox — the same runtime as the host and `aai dev` — loading the agent's
ESM bundle directly; the Modal sandbox (not a language runtime permission
model) is the security boundary.

  (`createSessionCore`); split across `session-core-messages.ts`
  (message/history handling) and `session-core-types.ts`

- `components/` — UI components (console-shell, chat-view, controls,
  message-list, start-screen, sidebar-layout, tool-call-block, button,
  aai-logo, tool-config-context)

#### packages/aai-server/

- `orchestrator.ts` — HTTP + WebSocket routing
- `sandbox.ts` — agent sandbox lifecycle + the host's control-channel view
  of it: `sessionUrl()` (the public tunnel endpoint the broker hands to
  clients), `activeSessions()` (the idle-eviction probe), `shutdown()`
- `sandbox-vm.ts` — per-agent sandbox configuration (bundle/load, teardown)
  and the one `spawnWarmHarness` dispatch over the two backends
- `sandbox-backend.ts` — backend selection policy (`SANDBOX_BACKEND` override,
  production → `modal`, local dev → `subprocess`) plus the reason string
  the boot log prints, so "which backend am I on, and why" is one log line
- `warm-harness.ts` — backend-independent guest wiring shared by both backends:
  dial-with-retry, stdio draining, free-port allocation, `WarmHarness` exit and
  cleanup semantics
- `sandbox-agent-config.ts` — the deploy-time `IsolateConfig` → runtime-agent
  boundary: `toRuntimeAgent` passes the config through unchanged minus the
  `WIRE_ONLY_CONFIG_FIELDS` deny-list (see "One canonical config schema")
- `sandbox-guest-rpc.ts` — guest→host `db/query` RPC schema + handler registration
- `sandbox-pool.ts` — pool of pre-warmed Node harnesses for fast cold starts
- `sandbox-slots.ts` — per-slug sandbox slots + session-aware idle eviction
  (probes the guest's `status` RPC before killing)
- `modal-sandbox.ts` — Modal Sandbox backend: creates remote sandboxes from
  a harness-baked snapshot image (built once per harness version, published
  under a content-addressed tag), execs the Node harness with a per-sandbox
  bearer token, and dials its WebSocket through the sandbox's Modal tunnel
- `packages/aai-guest/` — its own private workspace package: the Node guest
  entry point (runs inside a Modal Sandbox) that runs the COMPLETE agent.
  Serves three surfaces on the tunneled port: `/ws` (bearer-token host
  control channel — JSON-RPC `bundle/load`, one-shot `tool/execute`
  trials, `workspace/deploy` (Publish's in-guest `aai deploy`), `status`,
  `studio/session-init`; guest→host `db/query`,
  `studio/sync-workspace`, `studio/persist-chat`),
  `/session` (PUBLIC client voice sessions, connected directly by
  browsers — the embedded SDK runtime drives STT/LLM/TTS in-guest), and
  `/studio/chat` + `/studio/tools` (the studio coding agent's PUBLIC chat
  surface, bearer-gated by the caller's key — see "Browser studio").
  `harness.ts` (servers + dispatch), `trial.ts` (run_code executor +
  one-shot tool trials), `harness-rpc.ts` (guest→host request proxy),
  `studio-chat.ts`/`studio-tools.ts`/`studio-edit.ts`/`studio-grep.ts`
  (the in-guest coding agent), `studio-build.ts` (in-guest workspace
  builds through the aai CLI bundlers), `studio-publish.ts` (Publish =
  the literal `aai deploy` CLI, run in-sandbox), `limits.ts` (import-free constants
  mirroring the SDK's). The harness embeds NO agent runtime — every worker
  bundle ships its own (`__aaiCreateRuntime`, see "User-shipped runtime"
  below) — and tsdown bundles the harness (server shell + studio coding
  agent) into the single `dist/harness.mjs` the server resolves via
  `aai-guest/harness` and bakes into the snapshot image, keeping the build
  toolchain (`@alexkroman1/aai-cli`, the client-build plugins) EXTERNAL:
  it resolves at runtime from the node_modules next to the harness
- `modal_deploy.py` — Modal deployment of the agent service
  (`@modal.web_server` wrapping the node process);
  `pnpm --filter aai-server deploy:modal`
- `platform-lock.ts` — cross-replica per-slug mutation lock (see "Stateless
  server" below): Postgres lease rows in `aai_platform.slug_locks` in
  production, the in-process keyed lock in dev/tests
- `platform-epoch.ts` — cross-replica/service invalidation epochs (see
  "Split services" below): mutations bump `aai_platform.slug_epochs`,
  `resolveSandbox` rebuilds resident sandboxes on mismatch
- `sandbox-resolve.ts` — slot-based slug→sandbox resolution + epoch
  invalidation (split from sandbox.ts, which owns one sandbox's lifecycle)
- `studio-proxy.ts` / `app-middleware.ts` — the split deployment (see
  "Split services" below): the agent service's reverse proxy to the studio
  service, and the apps' shared base middleware
- `rpc-transport.ts` — WebSocket JSON-RPC transport for host↔guest RPC.
  Connections are typed by a per-direction method map (`RpcSchema`); the
  sandbox link's concrete map is `GuestRpcSchema` in `rpc-schemas.ts`, so
  method names and outgoing request params are compile-checked at every
  call site while results/incoming params stay `unknown` (untrusted wire
  data — Zod at the receiving site is the contract)
- `transport-websocket.ts` — WebSocket transport layer
- `auth.ts` — authentication/authorization
- `credentials.ts` — credential derivation
- `bundle-store.ts` — agent bundle storage (Supabase Storage via its
  S3-compatible endpoint in production, memory in dev/tests). Agent env
  lives in Supabase Vault through the injected `SecretStore`, not in the
  manifest blob.
- `deploy.ts` / `delete.ts` — deployment lifecycle
- `secret-handler.ts` — secret management
- `secret-store.ts` — `SecretStore` interface: Supabase Vault
  (`createVaultSecretStore`, over the `SUPABASE_DB_URL` Postgres
  connection) in production, in-memory for local dev/tests. Holds agent
  env (`agent-env:<slug>`) and app-database credentials (`app-db:<slug>`)
- `app-database.ts` — per-app Postgres schema/role provisioning in the
  platform Supabase database (`provisionAppDatabase`,
  `deprovisionAppDatabase`, `openAppDb`)
- `storage-handler.ts` — `GET/POST/DELETE /:slug/storage` (owner-auth'd)
  toggling the app's database
- `packages/aai-studio-server/` — the browser studio server side, its own
  package/service (see "Browser studio"):
  `studio-routes.ts` (HTTP surface), `studio-session-broker.ts` (per-project
  coding-agent sandboxes: boot via the shared warm-pool machinery, session
  install, guest RPC handlers, `buildWorkspace` for Publish, idle
  eviction), `studio-llm.ts` (gateway model config; the key is always the
  caller's), `studio-workspace-dir.ts` (materializes a workspace to a
  scratch dir — eval-suite only now), `studio-errors.ts`
  (`StudioBuildError`), `studio-deploy.ts` (guest build → validate config →
  deploy), `studio-workspace.ts` (project file store), `studio-prompt.ts`
  (system prompt from the scaffold CLAUDE.md), `studio-static.ts` (serves
  the built client)
- `packages/aai-studio-client/` — the studio's React front-end (Vite +
  Tailwind v4 + `useChat` + TanStack Query + CodeMirror), its own private
  workspace package built into its `dist/` by
  `pnpm --filter aai-studio-client build`. It talks to the server purely
  over HTTP/SSE (no code imports in either direction); aai-server serves
  the built artifact, resolved via `require.resolve` in
  `studio-static.ts` the same way aai-ui's `dist/default-client` is.
  Panes: `chat.tsx` (chat + composer), `code-view.tsx` / `preview.tsx`
  (the Code/Preview pane).

### Browser studio (aai-studio-server)

Loading the platform server root (`GET /`) serves the **studio** — a
browser-based coding agent (TypeScript agent loop on the Vercel AI SDK,
the same `streamText` stack pipeline mode uses) that builds and deploys
voice agents without the CLI:

- **Workspaces** are small server-side file trees stored one row per
  project in Postgres (`aai_platform.studio_workspaces`, over the same
  platform `SqlExec` Vault uses; in-memory store in dev/tests —
  `workspace-store.ts`, same two-implementation pattern as
  `SecretStore`). Blob `Storage` serves only deploy artifacts. Rows carry an
  optimistic `version`: writes go through `createWorkspace` /
  `mutateWorkspace` (`studio-workspace.ts`), which retry a conflicted write
  once — the in-process keyed lock (`studio-workspace-lock.ts`) still
  serializes local writers, so a conflict means another replica. `scope` is
  a *deterministic* SHA-256 of the caller's API key (`studioScope`) — unlike
  the salted argon2 ownership hashes, it must be stable so a browser session
  can find its projects again.
- **Chat runs IN the project's sandbox, and the browser connects to it
  DIRECTLY** — mirroring the voice path. `POST /studio/projects/:project/
  session` (rate-limited; `studio-session-broker.ts`) boots or reuses a
  guest sandbox through the same warm-pool/`spawnWarmHarness` machinery
  deployed agents use, installs the session over the control channel
  (`studio/session-init`: workspace files, the caller's own key, system
  prompt, model config), and returns the sandbox's public chat URL. The
  browser then streams turns straight to the guest's `POST /studio/chat`
  (SSE, the AI SDK UI message stream `useChat` consumes) — chat turns never
  pass through the platform host. The agentic loop (`streamText`, up to
  `MAX_CHAT_STEPS` = 16 steps) runs in the guest (`aai-guest/
  studio-chat.ts`) with Claude-Code-style tools over a real filesystem
  workspace (`aai-guest/studio-tools.ts`): list/read (windowed, numbered —
  opencode's read semantics)/write/edit/delete, `glob`, `grep`, `bash`
  (real shell in the container, guest token scrubbed from its env),
  `todo_write`, `test_agent`, and the keyless web builtins. Tool CPU —
  regex, diff, whatever `bash` runs — burns the tenant's own sandbox,
  which is why the host-side scan worker was deleted. The guest chat
  surface is bearer-gated by the caller's key (the tunnel URL is public)
  and CORS-open; `GET /studio/tools` on the same surface serves the
  user-friendly tool labels (`STUDIO_TOOL_LABELS`) the client renders.
  End of turn, the guest pushes state back over the control channel:
  `studio/sync-workspace` (validated like a client file PUT; only
  workspace source files — never node_modules/dist/.git — sync, under the
  same file caps) and `studio/persist-chat` (the settled conversation →
  `aai_platform.studio_chats`, restored on project open via
  `GET /studio/projects/:project/chat`). `test_agent` builds the live
  workspace IN the guest through the aai CLI's own bundlers
  (`aai-guest/studio-build.ts` — the toolchain node_modules are baked next
  to the harness) and loads/trials the bundle in place; Publish runs the
  literal CLI via the host→guest `workspace/deploy` RPC. Sandboxes are per
  (scope, project) with a 15-min idle eviction; a dead one heals on the next
  broker call, and the client re-brokers on a 409 from the chat surface.
  **`ensureSession` is serialized per (scope, project), and entries are
  disposed by identity, not by key.** Overlapping brokers for one project are
  routine (a double-click, a StrictMode double effect, a refresh landing on
  an in-flight one); unserialized, both take the cold path and the loser's
  sandbox is ORPHANED — absent from `sessions`, so neither the idle sweeper
  nor `dispose()` can ever reach it. It burns its orphan timeout plus Modal's
  idle window billed, and its `wire()` handlers stay live, so its end-of-turn
  `studio/sync-workspace` keeps writing the project behind the tracked
  sandbox's back. The identity check matters for the same reason
  `createOwnedMap` exists on the agent side: every cleanup runs after an
  await (a rejected re-init, a publish whose sandbox died mid-request), by
  which point the key may hold a replacement that must not be evicted.
- **No MCP.** The studio's coding agent has no MCP integration (the docs
  MCP server it once connected to was removed). The system prompt embeds a
  *snapshot* of the scaffold guide; anything outside it — a voice, a newly
  added gateway model, a provider option — the prompt tells the agent to
  look up with `visit_webpage` (the AssemblyAI docs included) rather than
  guess.
- **Guest tools carry their own deadlines** (`aai-guest/studio-tools.ts`):
  every tool is wrapped in a 120s timeout resolving to an error tool
  result, and `bash` has its own wall-clock kill (60s default, 300s max)
  with capped, tail-kept output. The client side of a hung turn is the
  composer's **Stop button** (`chat.tsx`): `useChat().stop()` aborts the
  SSE fetch to the sandbox, whose request-close handler aborts
  `streamText` and in-flight tools in the guest.
- **Web access**: the SDK's keyless `visit_webpage`, `get_page_design`,
  and `web_search` builtins (DuckDuckGo-backed — no key anywhere), mapped
  into the guest tool set (`createGuestWebTools` in `aai-guest/
  studio-chat.ts`). They run in the guest with open egress like all tenant
  code; `safeFetch` still screens the model-controlled URLs, and the tool
  context carries an empty env.
- **The preview shows the *published* agent**, so edits look like they did
  nothing until Publish. `hasUnpublishedChanges` (`studio-workspace.ts`)
  compares a `filesHash` of the workspace against `deployedHash`, recorded
  on every successful deploy, and `GET /studio/projects/:project` returns it
  as `unpublished` so the client never hashes anything. The preview then
  says so, with a Publish button in the banner. A hash rather than a
  timestamp for two reasons: publishing itself writes the workspace (which
  bumps `updatedAt`), and editing a file then undoing it should not leave
  the project permanently "stale".
- **The coding agent cannot publish.** There is deliberately no deploy
  tool: going live is the user's call, made with the Publish button
  (`POST /studio/projects/:project/deploy`). The prompt states this
  outright so the agent doesn't claim to have deployed or invent a live
  URL. Keep it that way — an agent that ships to a public URL on its own
  read of "make it live" is a surprise nobody asked for.
- **LLM selection** (`studio-llm.ts`): every studio turn runs on the
  AssemblyAI LLM Gateway **with the caller's own API key** — delivered to
  the guest via `studio/session-init` and resolved there (`resolveLlm` +
  the SDK's `assemblyAI` LLM factory); the platform holds no studio LLM
  credential. The *model* (never the key) stays host config: default
  `qwen3-next-80b-a3b`, `STUDIO_LLM_MODEL` overrides,
  `STUDIO_LLM_REGION=eu` region-filters. The caller's key doubles as the
  guest chat surface's bearer — same trust, no new secret. Host-side
  `studioModel(apiKey)` remains only for the eval judge.
- **Gateway regions.** `STUDIO_LLM_REGION=eu` selects the EU endpoint,
  which serves only Claude and most Gemini models. The gateway model list
  is therefore region-filtered (`GATEWAY_US_ONLY_MODELS`) and the EU
  default falls to `claude-sonnet-4-6`. Ordering the one
  `ASSEMBLYAI_GATEWAY_MODELS` array is what sets both defaults: the first
  entry surviving the region filter wins.
- **No per-request model switching.** `POST /studio/chat` accepts no
  `model` field (a stray one is stripped by the body schema, never
  honored): every turn runs on the host-configured default —
  `qwen3-next-80b-a3b` on the gateway. **A client can never name a provider or a
  model** — the only request-side credential is the caller's own bearer,
  which selects nothing: keep any future request-side choice validated
  host-side.
- **The coding agent itself runs on production infra**: each project gets
  one sandbox (`studio-session-broker.ts`) through the same
  warm-pool/`spawnWarmHarness` path deployed agents use (a remote Modal
  Sandbox). The whole agentic loop lives in that guest — LLM calls dial
  the gateway from the guest on the caller's key, tools run on the guest
  filesystem, and `test_agent` loads the built bundle in place and can
  trial-run its tools (no db — ctx.db reports storage-not-enabled): no
  tenant data and no platform secrets in the guest.
- **Builds AND publishes run IN the guest sandbox, through the aai CLI —
  one path.** There is no host-side, out-of-process, or Modal-Function
  build backend anymore (`studio-build-runner/-entry/-protocol/-cache`,
  `studio-bundle.ts`'s import allowlist, and `studio-client-build.ts` are
  all deleted). Two guest entry points:
  - `test_agent` builds the live session workspace via
    `aai-guest/studio-build.ts`, which dynamic-imports
    `@alexkroman1/aai-cli/worker-bundler` from the **toolchain
    `node_modules` baked next to the harness** (see "Modal sandbox notes");
    workspaces materialize under that root (`workspacesRoot()`) so bare
    imports (`@alexkroman1/aai`, `zod`, `react`, `@alexkroman1/aai-ui`)
    resolve by the normal walk-up, exactly as in a user project. Diagnostics
    are scrubbed guest-side (`formatBuildFailure`) and arrive as
    `buildError` prose the coding agent can act on.

    **The bundler runs in a ONE-SHOT CHILD PROCESS, and must keep doing
    so** (`aai-guest/studio-build-child.ts`; the parent side is
    `buildWorkspaceDir`). Rolldown — Vite 8's bundler — does its work in
    Rust, outside V8, and never returns that memory to the OS. Measured in
    a production sandbox, one in-process `buildWorker` took the harness
    from 258 MB to 1.7 GB RSS, of which V8's heap was **51 MB**; because
    the harness is long-lived and reused across `test_agent` calls, that
    peak became the floor and climbed with each build (1.7 → 2.1 →
    2.2 GB). Neither `global.gc()` (recovered 75 MB) nor
    `MALLOC_ARENA_MAX=2` (35 MB) is a fix — it is not V8's memory and not
    glibc arena fragmentation. Process exit is the only thing that
    reclaims it, which is the shape Publish already had.

    Two constraints come with that child. **It is the harness entry
    re-spawned with `BUILD_CHILD_FLAG`**, not a sibling script, because
    the guest ships ONE artifact (tsdown's `inlineDynamicImports`, and
    `modal-harness-image.ts` bakes exactly `/opt/aai/harness.mjs`);
    `harnessEntry()` resolves it from `import.meta.url` bundled, or
    `harness.ts` from source. And **the toolchain must not be imported
    anywhere else in the harness process** — the import alone costs ~90 MB
    and ~29 threads permanently, so `typecheckWorkspaceDir` (the
    `check_types` tool) imports only `@alexkroman1/aai-cli/typecheck`,
    which spawns the project's own `tsc` as its own child.

    Two gVisor details make this worse than it looks, and neither is
    fixable from inside the guest: `/proc/cpuinfo` reports the **host's**
    17 CPUs while the sandbox has 1 CPU of affinity (so Rolldown's Rust
    pool sizes for 17 — threads go 36 → 56 on the first build), and
    `os.totalmem()` reports 242 GB, from which V8 derives a 4,288 MB heap
    limit. Production sets neither `SANDBOX_MEMORY_LIMIT_MB` nor
    `SANDBOX_CPU_LIMIT`, so `memory.max` is 242 GB and nothing ever
    applies back-pressure. **Do not "fix" guest memory by setting
    `SANDBOX_MEMORY_LIMIT_MB` alone**: a cap under ~1.8 GB OOM-kills the
    sandbox mid-build, and `--max-old-space-size` cannot help because the
    memory is native, not V8's.
  - **Publish is the LITERAL `aai deploy` CLI**, spawned in the project's
    sandbox (`aai-guest/studio-publish.ts`, the host→guest
    `workspace/deploy` RPC on the session broker — live sandbox reused,
    else an ephemeral spawn torn down after). The guest completes the
    workspace into a REAL project (`ensureProjectShape` in
    `aai-guest/studio-project-shape.ts`: package.json, tsconfig.json,
    global.d.ts, and vite.config.ts filled in from scaffold-mirroring
    copies when absent — drift-guarded against the scaffold by
    `studio-project-shape.test.ts`; a dir-local `AAI_CONFIG_DIR` carries
    the caller's key; `.aai/project.json` pins the slug) and runs
    `aai deploy --server <origin> --json --allow-missing-secrets`. Build,
    upload, config extraction (`describeBundle` on the platform's standard
    `POST /deploy` route), ownership, reserved slugs, the
    ASSEMBLYAI_API_KEY env floor,
    and the credential preflight are therefore byte-for-byte the laptop
    path. The CLI's output — success, build diagnostics, deploy errors,
    preflight warnings — returns to the client, which **posts it into the
    chat** so the coding agent sees and can fix failures.
    `--allow-missing-secrets` (new CLI flag → `credentialPolicy: "warn"`
    in the deploy body) exists because the Secrets panel needs a deployed
    slug to attach secrets to — a hard preflight failure would deadlock
    first publishes. The public origin comes from `requestPublicOrigin`
    (studio-routes.ts) → `resolvePublicOrigin` (aai-server/public-origin.ts).
  A hostile or pathological workspace burns the tenant's own sandbox CPU —
  never the web container's. Covered end-to-end by
  `aai-server/workspace-build-integration.test.ts` (a real harness process
  publishing through the real CLI to a real listening orchestrator).
- **Secrets have their own panel; storage has none.** Deployed-agent
  secrets are managed in the studio client's Secrets panel
  (`secrets.tsx`), which talks to the platform's own `/:slug/secret`
  routes — the exact ones `aai secret` uses — and posts a note into the
  chat on every change (key names only, values withheld) so the coding
  agent knows which keys exist. Storage (`ctx.db`) is CLI-only
  (`aai storage enable <slug>`): the studio's storage routes and toggle
  were removed, and the prompt tells the agent to direct users to the CLI.
- **Vite must not be allowed to mutate `process.env`.** Vite's `build()`
  sets `NODE_ENV=production` when it is unset — a permanent, global side
  effect on the calling process. Both CLI bundlers therefore wrap the
  build in `withPreservedNodeEnv` (`aai-cli/_vite-env.ts`), which
  snapshots and restores it. Without that, `aai dev`, which rebuilds on
  every file change, flips itself to "production" on the first rebuild.
  Keep any new Vite invocation inside that wrapper.
- **Builds and deploys are TYPE-CHECKED.** `aai build` and `aai deploy`
  run the project's own `tsc --noEmit` (`aai-cli/typecheck.ts`, gated on a
  `tsconfig.json`, `--skipTypecheck` opts out), and the guest's
  `test_agent` build does the same before bundling — the bundlers strip
  types unchecked, which is exactly how the `send`/`state`
  runtime-working-but-wrong bugs shipped. Type errors reach the studio's
  coding agent as build/deploy output it can act on. The dev watch loop
  deliberately does NOT typecheck (editor/CI feedback is faster there).
- **`buildClient` runs with no `client.tsx` → `{}`** → the agent gets the
  default UI.
- **`buildClient` dedupes React** (`resolve.dedupe`), because `aai-ui`
  declares it as a *peer* dependency while the bundler resolves the bare
  `react/jsx-runtime` inside `aai-ui/dist/**` from *that file's* real path.
  Locally aai-ui's own devDependency satisfies it; a pruned production
  install can leave the build root's walk-up copy as the only React —
  reachable from the workspace root but not from `packages/aai-ui/dist`.
  Publishing died with *"Rolldown failed to resolve import
  react/jsx-runtime"* while every local build passed.
  `aai-cli/client-bundler.test.ts` guards this (every non-optional aai-ui
  peer is deduped). The Modal image installs the full workspace (dev deps
  included), so the old pruned-image packaging tests are gone with the
  Dockerfile.
- **Deployed-agent credentials.** The studio has no secrets UI, so a
  published agent would otherwise start with an empty env — its S2S
  connect sends an empty bearer token (`runtime-transport.ts`:
  `env[ASSEMBLYAI_API_KEY_ENV] ?? ""`) and AssemblyAI answers
  `unauthorized`. The bearer token a studio caller authenticates with *is*
  their AssemblyAI key (see `aai-cli/_config.ts`), so it is seeded as the
  agent's `ASSEMBLYAI_API_KEY`. That seeding is the **CLI's** job
  (`aai-cli/deploy.ts`: `env: { ASSEMBLYAI_API_KEY: apiKey, ...env }`), and
  studio Publish runs that same CLI in-guest — so it is an env **floor**, not
  an override: a key the user declared in `.env` targets a different account
  and wins. The server-side `DeployParams.defaultEnv` that used to do this
  was removed once Publish stopped calling the deploy core; `deployLocked`
  now merges only `{...storedEnv, ...env}`. This stays inside the
  credential-separation rule — it forwards *the caller's own* key, never a
  platform-owned one.
- **Client**: `packages/aai-studio-client` is a Vite-built React app;
  `studio-static.ts` resolves its `dist/` via `require.resolve` and serves
  it at `/` with hashed assets under `/studio-assets/`. When it hasn't
  been built, `GET /` serves a fallback page with build instructions
  (unit tests don't require it).
- **Reserved slugs** (`RESERVED_SLUGS` in `schemas.ts`): `studio` and
  `studio-assets` can never be claimed as agent slugs — they would shadow
  the studio routes. Enforced in `validateSlug`, `DeployBodySchema`, and
  the deploy core.

### `ctx.generate` (one-shot LLM generation)

Tool `execute` code gets one-shot LLM generation via `ctx.generate` — a
**runtime capability like `ctx.db`**. One implementation,
`createGenerateFn` (`host/generate.ts`, exported from `/runtime`), runs
wherever the runtime runs — inside the guest sandbox on the platform,
in-process under `aai dev`: descriptors resolve through the same
`resolveLlm` registry as the pipeline model, credentials from the agent env
only. Defaults to the agent's own pipeline `llm`; a per-call `llm`
descriptor works for S2S agents holding that provider's key.

`GenerateOptions.schema` is **plain JSON Schema, never a Zod schema** — the
options must survive the RPC boundary, and the implementation rejects Zod
schemas so dev and prod cannot drift; convert with `z.toJSONSchema()`.
(The pattern-combinator layer that once wrapped this —
`@alexkroman1/aai/patterns`, earlier `@alexkroman1/aai/workflow` — was
removed unused; multi-step orchestration is composed directly over
`ctx.generate`.)

### Session modes

Each agent runs in one of two session modes, selected at parse time by
`parseManifest()` based on which top-level fields are present in the
`agent()` config:

- **S2S mode** (default — no `stt`/`llm`/`tts` fields in `agent.ts`) uses
  `createS2sTransport()` in `packages/aai/host/transports/s2s-transport.ts`.
  The host opens a single WebSocket to AssemblyAI's speech-to-speech
  service; STT, the LLM loop, and TTS all run service-side and audio/events
  relay through that one socket. This is the original architecture.
- **Pipeline mode** (triggered when all three of `stt`, `llm`, and `tts`
  are set) uses `createPipelineTransport()` in
  `packages/aai/host/transports/pipeline-transport.ts`. Here the host
  drives the LLM loop itself via the Vercel AI SDK's `streamText`, and STT
  and TTS are pluggable providers imported from the `@alexkroman1/aai/stt`
  and `@alexkroman1/aai/tts` subpath exports.

Partial provider configs are rejected at parse time — `parseManifest()`
requires either zero or all three of `stt`/`llm`/`tts`.

- **Tool-call args must be coerced before they hit a wire schema.** The AI
  SDK surfaces an unparsable/unknown tool call as a `tool-call` stream part
  whose `input` is the *raw argument string*, not a parsed object. The
  WebSocket `tool_call` event requires a record for `args`, so every emitter
  routes args through `toArgsRecord` (`sdk/utils.ts`; non-records become
  `{}`), and a failed/invalid call is recorded with an error `result` rather
  than left dangling.

- **The capture worklet** (`worklets/capture-processor.ts`) is the single
  mic-capture processor. It flushes a `slice()` copy and keeps its own
  buffer (re-reading a just-transferred view is how a mic once went
  permanently deaf), with start/stop gating, a stop → flush → `stopped`-ack
  protocol, and the dead-mic probe. Two guards remain load-bearing:
  `instantiateWorklet`'s harness honors the transfer list (`structuredClone`
  with `transfer`, which really detaches) and caps posted messages so a
  runaway loop is a named failure rather than a hang, and
  `worklets/capture-processor.test.ts` exercises the processor source.

- **Pre-connection client config**: the default client page is
  byte-identical for every agent and the CSP bars inline scripts, so the
  agent's display name and greeting reach the browser via a pre-connection
  endpoint: `GET /client-config` (dev server) / `GET /:slug/client-config`
  (platform, unauthenticated — parity with the page and the WebSocket)
  returns `{ name, greeting }` (`sdk/client-config.ts`, re-exported from
  `/protocol`). **Every server builds the body through one helper**,
  `buildClientConfig`; the platform's handler lives in
  `aai-server/client-config-handler.ts`. In `aai-ui`, `client()`'s config
  tier renders `DefaultRoot`, which fetches the config (any failure degrades
  to the empty default, so older servers keep working) and mounts the chat
  shell; the shell uses the server-declared `name` unless `client({ name })`
  overrides it. A custom `component` ignores all of it. The `aai dev` Vite
  proxy forwards `/client-config` to the backend.

  **The session's per-attempt broker lookup uses `loadClientConfig`, not
  `fetchClientConfig`** — it returns `null` for a lookup that produced no
  answer, keeping that distinct from a server that answered and named no
  `sessionUrl`. Degrading both to `{}` is fine for name/greeting and wrong
  here: `session-core.ts` latches `serverIsBroker = false` on a config with
  no `sessionUrl`, and that latch skips the broker fetch on every later
  attempt. So one 503 — a sandbox mid-boot, or one that failed to start —
  pinned the client to the platform's `/:slug/websocket`, whose WebSocket
  redirect browsers do not follow (sessions go straight to the sandbox now),
  with no route back even after the agent recovered. Only an ANSWERED lookup
  may set the latch.

- **There is no text-only mode.** Every pipeline agent declares a real TTS
  provider, and the default `ChatView` always renders the voice `Controls`.
  The snapshot's `apiUrl` field carries the programmatic WebSocket endpoint,
  shown by `ApiUrlChip`. **It is the LONG-LIVING platform endpoint**
  (`wss://host/:slug/websocket`), never the brokered sandbox tunnel URL the
  session actually connects to — the tunnel URL dies with the sandbox (idle
  eviction, redeploy), so surfacing it hands users a link that rots. The
  platform endpoint stays valid: a plain upgrade on it resolves the live
  sandbox (booting it like the client-config broker) and answers a 302
  redirect to the sandbox's current session URL (`orchestrator-ws.ts`,
  query preserved so `?sessionId=` resumes survive). Programmatic WebSocket
  clients that follow handshake redirects land on the sandbox; browsers
  don't follow WebSocket redirects, which is fine — the browser path is the
  client-config broker.

Reference providers shipped today:

- **STT**: one of
  - `assemblyAI({ model: "universal-3-5-pro" })` — `ASSEMBLYAI_API_KEY`
  - `deepgram({ model: "nova-3" })` — `DEEPGRAM_API_KEY`
  - `elevenlabs({ model: "scribe_v2_realtime" })` — `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY`
  - `soniox({ model: "stt-rt-v3" })` — `SONIOX_API_KEY`

  **Never inherit the `assemblyai` SDK's connect deadline.** Its default
  `connectTimeout` is **1000 ms** and covers far more than a socket open: the
  timer is armed before the WebSocket is constructed and only cleared when the
  server's `Begin` message arrives, so DNS + TCP + TLS + upgrade + the
  service's session-start latency all have to fit. A link measuring ~50 ms to
  TLS still blew it — a slow `Begin`, or a host event loop briefly blocked
  (this is a wall-clock `setTimeout`, not an I/O deadline), is enough. All
  three attempts then failed identically and the session died on a fatal
  `stt_connect_failed`, which reads as a provider outage and is not one.
  `host/providers/stt/assemblyai.ts` therefore always sets
  `connectTimeout`/`maxConnectionRetries`/`connectionRetryDelay` from
  `STT_CONNECT_*` in `sdk/constants.ts`, overridable per agent via
  `assemblyAI({ connectTimeoutMs, maxConnectRetries })`. The retry policy is
  pinned rather than left to the SDK so the worst-case open time is arithmetic
  we own: it runs inside `session.start()`, so a budget exceeding
  `DEFAULT_SESSION_START_TIMEOUT_MS` could only surface as the less specific
  "session.start() timed out". `assemblyai.test.ts` asserts that sum.
- **LLM**: one of the typed factories below — each returns a pure
  descriptor; the `@ai-sdk/*` package is only imported by the host-side
  resolver (`host/providers/resolve.ts`), never by the agent bundle:
  - `anthropic({ model })` — `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
  - `openai({ model })` — `OPENAI_API_KEY`
  - `google({ model })` — `GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY`
  - `mistral({ model })` — `MISTRAL_API_KEY`
  - `xai({ model })` — `XAI_API_KEY`
  - `groq({ model })` — `GROQ_API_KEY`
  - `openrouter({ model })` — `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`; routes through
    [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai)'s OpenAI-compatible
    chat-completions endpoint, one key fronting hundreds of models
    addressed as `"creator/model"` (e.g.
    `openrouter({ model: "meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct" })`).
    Resolved via `@ai-sdk/openai`'s `.chat()` client pointed at the
    OpenRouter base URL — no extra `@ai-sdk/*` dependency.
  - `gateway({ model })` — `AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY`; routes through the
    [Vercel AI Gateway](https://vercel.com/docs/ai-gateway), one endpoint
    fronting hundreds of models addressed as `"creator/model"` (e.g.
    `gateway({ model: "zai/glm-4.6" })`). Resolved via `createGateway`
    from the `ai` package — no extra `@ai-sdk/*` dependency.
  - `assemblyAI({ model, region? })` — `ASSEMBLYAI_API_KEY`; routes through
    the [AssemblyAI LLM Gateway](https://www.assemblyai.com/docs/llm-gateway)
    (OpenAI-compatible chat-completions endpoint fronting 25+ models) via
    `@ai-sdk/openai`'s `.chat()` client. `region: "eu"` selects the EU
    endpoint. Same factory name as the STT provider — alias one on import.
    The client is built with a `fetch` wrapper,
    `repairOpenAiStream` (`host/providers/_openai-stream-repair.ts`): the
    gateway documents streamed responses for OpenAI models only, and its
    Claude streams break two AI SDK expectations. (1) `tool_calls` deltas
    arrive with no `id`/`type`, which makes `StreamingToolCallTracker` in
    `@ai-sdk/provider-utils` throw `Expected 'id' to be a string` and kill any
    turn that calls a tool — the wrapper fills in a synthetic id (stable per
    tool-call index within one response) and `type: "function"`, leaving real
    ids alone. (2) The final usage-only chunk carries `"choices": null` where
    the schema requires an array, so the turn dies with "Type validation
    failed" *after* the reply has streamed — the wrapper rewrites that null to
    `[]` (an absent `choices` stays absent). Every other byte passes through.
    Remove each repair once the gateway emits conformant frames.
- **TTS**: one of
  - `cartesia({ voice })` — `CARTESIA_API_KEY`
  - `rime({ voice })` — `RIME_API_KEY`
  - `assemblyAI({ voice, language? })` — `ASSEMBLYAI_API_KEY`; AssemblyAI's
    streaming TTS over `wss://streaming-tts.assemblyai.com/v1/ws/`. Third
    factory named `assemblyAI` (STT and LLM have one too) — alias on import.
    Sharing one key with STT and the gateway means an all-AssemblyAI pipeline
    needs exactly one secret. Two protocol details that are easy to get wrong:
    the streaming sockets authenticate with the **raw** key, not `Bearer`, and
    production sends no `Begin` frame until the client speaks first, so the
    adapter must not block waiting for one (the AssemblyAI CLI does, which is
    why it marks prod streaming TTS unavailable). Turns end on `FlushDone`;
    a rejected key arrives in-band as an `Error` frame, i.e. as
    `tts_stream_error` rather than `tts_auth_failed`.

    A third, and the one that decides whether the agent feels responsive:
    **`Generate` only buffers — `Flush` is what starts synthesis.** Unlike
    Cartesia (`continue: true` synthesizes on arrival), relaying LLM deltas and
    flushing once makes time-to-first-audio the length of the whole turn, since
    the pipeline's only provider-level flush is the end-of-turn drain
    (`flushTtsAndWait`, once per reply — after every LLM step *and* tool call).
    A tool-chaining reply was silent for its entire duration, `holdPhrase` and
    the dead-air cover included, as those are just more buffered text. The
    adapter therefore buffers host-side and emits `Generate`+`Flush` per
    *sentence*: measured, that is ~350ms to first audio instead of the full
    turn, for ~4% more total audio, where flushing every word-granularity delta
    costs 2.6x and sounds disjointed. Two invariants come with it — only the
    turn's **last** acknowledgement may emit `done` (`flushTtsAndWait` resolves
    on it, so a segment's `FlushDone` leaking through advances the orchestrator
    mid-reply), and the end-of-turn flush is never sent empty, so `done` never
    depends on the service acking a contentless `Flush`. See the module doc in
    `host/providers/tts/assemblyai.ts` for the measurements.

The provider SDKs (`ai`, `assemblyai`, `@cartesia/cartesia-js`,
`@ai-sdk/*`, …) are regular dependencies of `@alexkroman1/aai`, but they
are only imported by the host-side openers/resolvers in
`host/providers/` — the descriptor factories in `sdk/providers/` are pure
data, so agent bundles never pull provider SDKs into the guest sandbox.

Each provider defines its `KIND` tag and `<PROVIDER>_API_KEY_ENV`
constant once in its `sdk/providers/{stt,tts,llm}/<name>.ts` module.
Adding a provider means: descriptor factory there, an opener in
`host/providers/{stt,tts}/` (built on the shared session shell in
`host/providers/_utils.ts`), and one registry/switch entry in
`host/providers/resolve.ts`.

### Voices

**`ASSEMBLYAI_TTS_VOICES` in `sdk/providers/tts/assemblyai.ts` is the list.**
Read it there; do not restate it here, and do not trust a voice name that
isn't in it.

That instruction is the whole point of the constant. This section used to
carry its own table — `ivy`, `sam`, `mia`, `jack`, `sophie`, `oliver` and a
dozen more — of which every entry was either deprecated or had never
existed, and it claimed a `voice:` field on `agent()` that the SDK does not
have. The provider's doc comment carried a *different* wrong list
(`azelma`, `cosette`, `fantine`, `javert`, …, none published). Two
hand-maintained lists, both fiction, both pointed at by anyone looking for a
voice.

The failure they cause is invisible at authoring time: a wrong voice id is
rejected in-band after the TTS socket opens, so the agent connects, reports
ready, and is permanently silent. Nothing before a live session catches it.
Hence one checkable constant, with the accent alongside each name and the
deprecated set kept separately in `ASSEMBLYAI_TTS_DEPRECATED_VOICES`.

Pipeline mode picks the voice with `assemblyAI({ voice })` from
`@alexkroman1/aai/tts` (or `assemblyAIPipeline({ voice })`). S2S mode's
voice rides on the `s2s` descriptor — there is no top-level `voice:` field.

### Storage (`ctx.db`)

There is no KV store anymore. Persistent state is the opt-in **app
database**: enabling storage for an app (CLI `aai storage enable` — the
studio deliberately has NO storage toggle, so this is a CLI-only action;
or `DATABASE_URL` in the project `.env` under
`aai dev`) gives its tools `ctx.db` — a SQL handle
(`query<T>(sql, params?)`, `$1` placeholders) backed by a per-app schema in
the platform's Supabase Postgres. Accessing `ctx.db` without storage
enabled throws with that enablement guidance. On the platform each app
gets its own schema + login role (search_path pinned, 10s
statement_timeout); credentials live in Supabase Vault. Session-scoped
scratch belongs in `ctx.state` (or the `remember`/`recall` builtins, now
in-memory per-session).

There is no Vector store anymore — `ctx.vector`, the `vector:` agent field,
the `@alexkroman1/aai/vector` subpath, and the platform-owned
`PINECONE_API_KEY` were all removed. If retrieval comes back it will be a
Supabase (pgvector) store following the same path as `ctx.db`: per-app
schema, platform-provisioned credentials in Vault, host-proxied RPC.
`ctx.db` reaches the guest as host-proxied RPC (`db/query`).

### Guest network access

There is **no per-agent egress policy**. `allowedHosts` and its enforcement
stack (the SDK's `tool-egress`/`guest-fetch-policy` in-process guard, the
platform's Modal outbound-domain allowlist, `guest-egress.ts`) were removed:
the agent's own code runs in the guest with open egress, exactly as it does
under `aai dev`. The Modal container is the isolation boundary — a tenant
can reach the internet, not the platform. Tool code and providers `fetch`
directly.

**The network builtins follow one rule: screen only when there is no
container around us** (`builtinFetch` in `host/ssrf.ts`).

- **Contained** (a Modal Sandbox) → plain `pinnedFetch`, no SSRF screen. The
  screen guards nothing a tenant cannot bypass in one line, because their own
  tool code has open egress by design — so it constrains the *model*, not the
  author. The container is the boundary, it holds no platform credentials, and
  `ctx.db` is host-proxied RPC.
- **Not contained** (`aai dev`, and the subprocess backend) → `safeFetch`.
  Here the host IS someone's machine: these same builtins run in the
  developer's own process, where a model-controlled URL can reach localhost,
  the LAN, or cloud metadata. That is the case the screen exists for.

Containment is **declared by the spawner**, never inferred by the guest:
`modal-sandbox.ts` sets `AAI_SANDBOX_CONTAINED=1` in the exec env and the
subprocess backend does not. "Am I a guest" and "am I contained" are
different questions — the subprocess backend runs a guest with no container
at all, so a guest-token sniff would open egress on a developer's laptop.
`ssrf.test.ts` pins that distinction.

The residual risk in a container is prompt injection steering the model at an
internal endpoint; accepted, because the sandbox has nothing internal worth
reaching and an author who wants that can already write it.

### Dev/prod parity

**The guest IS the dev server — and the runtime IS the user's.** The
harness wraps the same `createServer` (`aai/host/server.ts`) that `aai dev`
runs — health, `client-config`, and `/websocket` sessions — adding only the
`/ws` control channel via `ServerOptions.upgrade` and a lazy runtime facade
(`lazyRuntime` in `aai-guest/harness.ts`: the runtime is built on the first
session, never at bundle/load, because inspection loads carry an empty env).
The runtime itself comes from the BUNDLE (see "User-shipped runtime"
below), so dev and prod run the identical SDK version: the one in the
user's lockfile. The bundle arrives over RPC and loads from a temp-file
`file:` URL.

### User-shipped runtime

The worker bundle ships its own SDK runtime. `buildWorker`'s generated
wrapper entry exports `__aaiCreateRuntime` — a factory over the *user's
installed* SDK's `createRuntime`, bundled in with the provider SDKs (an SSR
Vite build: server resolve conditions, `node:` builtins external, dynamic
imports inlined via `codeSplitting: false`) — and the harness builds every
session through it. The harness embeds no runtime at all, so **platform SDK
drift can never break a deployed agent**: it runs exactly the runtime
version it was built and tested against, the same one `aai dev` ran.

- The harness↔bundle contract is deliberately tiny (`CreateGuestRuntime` in
  `aai-guest/harness-types.ts`): `{ env, db?, runCode? }` in,
  `{ startSession, shutdown }` out. Keep it that way — everything else
  (provider resolution, tool dispatch, session state) is the bundle's SDK's
  business, on the bundle's SDK's version.
- A bundle without the factory is rejected at `bundle/load` ("rebuild with
  a current @alexkroman1/aai-cli"); there is no embedded-runtime fallback.
- Deploy artifacts are therefore ~8 MB minified before user code
  (`MAX_WORKER_SIZE` is 30 MB), and `evalWorkerBundle` imports workers via
  a temp `file:` URL — the bundled runtime's CJS interop calls
  `createRequire(import.meta.url)`, which rejects `data:` URLs.
- The dev server passes `runtime: false` to `buildWorker`: it builds its
  runtime in-process from the same installed SDK anyway, and inlining the
  runtime on every watch rebuild would make reloads multi-second.
  `aai build` / `aai deploy` / studio builds always ship it.

**Known remaining asymmetries**, none closable without larger work:

| Divergence | Direction | Why it stands |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Modal memory/CPU limits (`SANDBOX_MEMORY_LIMIT_MB`, `SANDBOX_CPU_LIMIT`) | works in dev, fails in prod | `aai dev` runs tools in the host process with no caps; a memory-hungry tool OOMs only when deployed. |
| `run_code` | fails in dev, works in prod | The host-side guard refuses rather than evaluating in-process. Fail-closed, so harmless. |
| `withHostCredentialFallback` (`providers/host-env.ts`) | works in dev, fails in prod | Deliberate ergonomic: an exported `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` should work for `aai dev`. Two guards keep the cliff visible: the dev server warns when a required key resolved from the shell only (`agentEnvWarnings` in `_dev-server.ts` — it won't survive `aai deploy`, which uploads `.env`), and the deploy core preflights required credentials (below), so the failure surfaces at deploy time, not as an auth error at first session. |
| `ctx.db` backing (BYO `DATABASE_URL` in dev vs platform-provisioned schema+role) | prod is stricter | Dev connects wherever the developer points it; prod pins search_path + statement_timeout on a per-app role. |
| Platform sandboxes need Modal credentials in production only | prod is stricter | `aai dev` runs tools in-process; the platform spawns real Modal sandboxes in production (`MODAL_TOKEN_ID`/`MODAL_TOKEN_SECRET`), and an isolation-free child process in local dev — see "Modal sandbox notes". |

**Deploy-time credential preflight** (`missingCredentials` in
`aai-server/deploy.ts`). The classic dev/prod credential failure — an agent
that ran locally on shell-exported keys dies at first session start after
deploy with what looks like a provider outage — is caught at the deploy
boundary instead. The required key set is derived from the bundle's
self-described config (never from anything a client sent):
`requiredProviderEnvVars` over the stt/llm/tts/s2s descriptors (the same
registry-backed derivation the runtime resolves keys with) plus the agent's
declared `requiredEnv` (an `agent()` field for custom keys tools read from
`ctx.env`, which no static derivation can see). A key whose merged stored
value is absent or empty fails `POST /deploy` with a 400 naming the keys
(`credentialPolicy: "require"`, the default). The studio deploys with
`credentialPolicy: "warn"` instead — it has no secrets UI, so a hard failure
would leave its user with no path to publish at all; the warning rides back
on the deploy response. The check runs before any side effect, so a rejected
deploy leaves the live sandbox untouched.

**One canonical config schema, deny-list boundaries.** The dropped-field bug
family (`builtinTools` — deployed agents silently lost the default cognitive
builtins; `send`; the provider triple) all came from
allow-list mappers re-declaring the config field list, where every field is
optional and an omission is valid TypeScript. Every such bug presents as a
*working* agent quietly ignoring part of its own config. The design is now
inverted — one canonical serializable schema flows CLI → server → runtime
unchanged, and each boundary subtracts an explicit deny-list instead of
copying fields:

- **`AgentConfigSchema`** (`sdk/_internal-types.ts`) is the canonical shape.
  `toAgentConfig` strips `HOST_ONLY_AGENT_FIELDS` (`tools`, `state`) plus
  undefined values and validates through the schema — no per-field copies.
  `_internal-types.test.ts` asserts the one subtraction:
  `Exclude<keyof AgentDef, keyof AgentConfig | HostOnlyAgentField>` is `never`.
- **`agent()`** derives its parameter shape from `AgentDef`
  (`AgentParams` = `Omit` + `Partial<Pick>` of the defaulted fields) instead
  of re-declaring it inline — the inline form is how `send` and `state`
  shipped as runtime-working but excess-property errors for authors
  (neither bundler typechecks user code). `define.test-d.ts` locks this.
- **`IsolateConfigSchema`** (`aai-server/rpc-schemas.ts`) is
  `AgentConfigSchema.extend({...})` — the extensions are wire-tolerance
  loosenings (a stored bundle from an older CLI must keep loading), wire
  defaults, and the wire-only `toolSchemas`; none may drop a field.
- **`toRuntimeAgent`** (`aai-server/sandbox-agent-config.ts`) passes the
  whole config through minus `WIRE_ONLY_CONFIG_FIELDS` (`toolSchemas`,
  `mode`). The provider descriptors ride on the runtime agent itself
  (`createRuntime` resolves `opts.stt ?? agent.stt`), keyed off the
  descriptors' own presence — never `config.mode`, which is optional: a
  config carrying all three providers with no `mode` once hit a
  `config.mode === "pipeline"` gate and lost every one of them, so
  `createRuntime` resolved S2S and ran a healthy S2S session on the agent's
  own key, nothing logged. `superRefine` rejects a `mode` that disagrees
  with the descriptors. Host mode (`ws-host-mode.ts`) uses the same
  function, so a pipeline agent driven over `?host=1` stays pipeline.
  `rpc-schemas.test.ts` asserts both subtractions:
  `Exclude<keyof AgentConfig, keyof IsolateConfig>` and
  `Exclude<keyof IsolateConfig, keyof AgentDef | WireOnlyConfigField>` are
  `never`.

A new serializable agent field therefore needs exactly two edits — `AgentDef`
(docs + type) and `AgentConfigSchema` (shape) — and the type guards fail
loudly if either half is missing; no mapper edits, and the field reaches the
server, the wire, and the runtime by default.

**Never let S2S be a fallback.** `buildTransport`
(`host/runtime-transport.ts`) reaches `buildAssemblyS2sTransport` by
fallthrough, so any path that loses the providers yields a fully functional
session in the wrong mode. Two rules keep that diagnosable: forward providers
based on their own presence (above), and `createRuntime` logs
`"Session mode resolved"` once per runtime with the mode and provider kinds —
"which transport is this agent on" must be answerable from one log line rather
than inferred from the shape of the message stream (`S2S <<` prefixes).

### Data flow

On the platform, the browser's session WebSocket connects DIRECTLY to the
agent's sandbox (`/session` on its Modal tunnel, discovered via the
`GET /:slug/client-config` broker) — "server" below means the process
running the runtime: the guest harness on the platform, the `aai dev`
server locally. Audio path depends on the session mode (see above):

- **S2S mode**: user speaks → browser captures PCM → WebSocket → server
  relays audio into a single AssemblyAI S2S socket → agentic loop (LLM +
  tools) runs service-side → synthesized audio streams back through the
  same socket → server forwards to browser → user can interrupt at any
  time (cancels the in-flight turn).
- **Pipeline mode**: user speaks → browser captures PCM → WebSocket →
  server forwards audio to the STT provider → STT partials stream to the
  client as `user_transcript_partial` (live captions) and drive
  `speech_started`/`speech_stopped` edges → the committed transcript fires
  `onUserTranscript` → host runs the LLM loop locally via `streamText`
  (tool calls execute on the host just like S2S mode) → assistant text
  chunks stream into the TTS provider → synthesized audio returns over
  the client WebSocket → interrupts cancel the in-flight LLM stream and
  TTS playback. A barge-in that never commits a user turn is treated as a
  false interruption and the reply resumes (see
  `falseInterruptionTimeoutMs`).

### Client audio path (browser ⇄ server)

Both legs carry **raw PCM16 over the session WebSocket** — 384 kbps down at
24 kHz, 256 kbps up at 16 kHz, uncompressed, with the mic streaming
continuously (barge-in needs it open). That budget is the backdrop for
everything below: a jitter buffer absorbs *jitter*, and no size of buffer
fixes a link that cannot carry the bitrate in real time.

**Playback is a jitter buffer with hysteresis, not a startup delay**
(`aai-ui/worklets/playback-processor.ts`). It fills to `PLAYBACK_JITTER_MS`
before a turn speaks, and on an underrun it returns to filling — to the
shorter `PLAYBACK_REFILL_MS`, because mid-reply a long wait is itself a hole
in the speech. The re-arm is the whole point: while the gate only guarded the
*start* of a turn, one stall left `readPos` chasing `writePos` and every later
quantum emitted a few real samples padded with silence, so a single network
hiccup turned the rest of the reply into ~5ms fragments — stutter through
every word rather than one pause. A starved quantum never advances `readPos`,
so buffered audio survives intact.

Gaps are **concealed**, not zero-filled: the worklet loops the retained tail
of played audio under a decay to silence (`PLAYBACK_CONCEAL_FADE_MS`). A hard
zero-fill is a discontinuity mid-word, which is what makes a brief stall sound
like breakage rather than a pause.

**Underruns are reported, in WebRTC's counter shape.** Each turn's `stop`
message carries `concealedSamples`, `silentConcealedSamples` (a subset, as in
`getStats()`), `concealmentEvents`, and `silentConcealmentEvents`, surfaced as
`VoiceIOOptions.onPlaybackStats` and logged by the default session. Nothing
else marks an underrun — the session still reports `"speaking"` and `done()`
still settles — so this is the only way to tell a turn that needed its cushion
from one that didn't, and the only honest basis for retuning
`PLAYBACK_JITTER_MS`. A high `silentConcealedSamples` share means the stall
outran what concealment can cover, i.e. a bandwidth problem rather than a
tuning one.

**The server paces audio out at a bounded lead** (`aai/host/audio-pacer.ts`,
wired into `ws-handler.ts`'s `ClientSink`). TTS outruns playback, so relaying
each provider frame on arrival put a whole reply into the socket buffer at
once; on a slow link that is seconds of queue the server cannot see into,
bounded only by the `MAX_CLIENT_WS_BUFFERED_BYTES` disconnect.
`CLIENT_AUDIO_LEAD_MS` **must stay above `PLAYBACK_JITTER_MS`** — the lead is
the client's only source of cushion, so pacing at exactly real time would
leave the playback buffer unable to fill. Holding audio back makes two
orderings load-bearing, both enforced by the pacer:

- `audio_done` is queued **behind** pending audio. It is a turn boundary; the
  worklet takes it as "this is all there is", so an early one truncates the
  reply.
- A `cancelled`/`reset` event **discards** held audio. The client flushes its
  own buffer on those events, so anything still held would arrive afterwards
  and play as an orphan fragment.

**Capture runs on its own AudioContext at the STT rate**, and the worklet
converts no rates (`aai-ui/worklets/capture-processor.ts`). The browser's
resampler is band-limited; the linear interpolation this replaced folded
everything above the new Nyquist back into the band as aliasing. Playback
keeps a separate context at the TTS rate, and the two collapse into one when
the rates match. There is deliberately **no fallback resampler**: `audio.ts`
asserts the browser honored both requested rates and fails init otherwise,
because a context at another rate either ships audio to a socket that declared
a different rate or plays PCM at the wrong speed — a loud failure beats
either.

**Capture is raw voice, echo cancellation aside.** Both `getUserMedia`
call sites (the WebSocket mic and `createPttRecorder`) share one exported
`VOICE_CAPTURE_CONSTRAINTS`, because copies of the object drifted apart
trivially. `autoGainControl`, `noiseSuppression`, and `voiceIsolation` are all
**off**: each rewrites the signal before STT sees
it — AGC continuously retargets level, so it rides the noise floor up through
silence, while
suppression and isolation discard signal and can gate a quiet room to *exact*
zeros, which is also what a dead mic looks like. `echoCancellation` stays on:
the mic is open while the agent speaks (barge-in needs it), so without AEC the
agent hears itself and interrupts its own reply.

**A dead microphone is detected once per session.** An OS-muted or wrong input
device delivers digital silence, which from every other vantage point is
identical to a user who has not spoken: socket up, session listening, no turn
ever committed. The capture worklet watches the first `MIC_SILENCE_PROBE_MS`
for any nonzero sample (a live mic in a quiet room still carries a noise
floor) and reports once via `VoiceIOOptions.onMicSilent`. It disarms on the
first real sample, so it costs nothing after the window and cannot fire
mid-session.

## Conventions

- **Runtime**: Node everywhere (host, platform server, and guest sandbox)
- **Frameworks**: React (client UI), Tailwind CSS v4 (compiled at bundle time)
- **Linting**: Biome. Auto-runs on staged files via lefthook pre-commit hook.
  **Every package needs a `lint` script** (`biome check .`) or `turbo run
  lint` — and so `pnpm check` — silently skips it; `aai-templates` had none.
  Filename conventions are Biome's job too (`useFilenamingConvention`,
  kebab-case), which replaced a never-invoked `ls-lint` whose config existed
  but which no pipeline ran and which blocked for 30+ minutes at repo root.
  Template tool files are exempted by an override: their names mirror
  snake_case LLM tool names.
- **Exports**: In dev mode, package.json exports point to `.ts` source for
  seamless workspace resolution. Update to compiled `.js` dist paths before
  publishing.

### File naming conventions

| Pattern | Meaning | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `_foo.ts` | **Internal module** — not part of the public API. Never import cross-package. Biome's `noPrivateImports` rule enforces this at lint time. | `_utils.ts`, `_bundler.ts`, `_internal-types.ts` |
| `foo-barrel.ts` | **Barrel re-export file** — aggregates exports from multiple modules into one subpath export. Has `biome-ignore` for `noReExportAll`. | `runtime-barrel.ts`, `manifest-barrel.ts` |
| `foo.test.ts` | **Unit test** — co-located with source. Runs via `pnpm test`. | `session.test.ts` |
| `foo.test-d.ts` | **Type-level test** — checked by tsc, never executed at runtime. Uses `expectTypeOf`. | `types.test-d.ts` |
| `_test-utils.ts` | **Test helpers** — each package has its own with different utilities (see below). | `host/_test-utils.ts` |

### `_test-utils.ts` per package (not interchangeable)

Each package has distinct test helpers tailored to its domain:

- **`aai/host/_test-utils.ts`** — `flush()` (microtask yield), `makeTool()`,
  `makeAgent()`, `makeConfig()`, fixture replay helpers for S2S mocking
- **`aai-cli/_test-utils.ts`** — `withTempDir()` (temp dir + cleanup),
  `silenceSteps()`, `silenced()`, `makeBundle()`. The dev-server specs share
  their mock scaffolding (fake chokidar, runtime/server mocks) via
  `_dev-server-test-utils.ts`. A `_test-setup.ts` setup file points
  `AAI_CONFIG_DIR` at a per-run temp dir so tests can never touch the
  developer's real `~/.config/aai/config.json` (API key + approved servers).
- **`aai-ui/_react-test-utils.ts`** — `createMockSessionCore()`,
  `MockAudioContext`, `installAudioMocks()`
- **`aai-server/test-utils.ts`** — (no underscore) `createMockKv()`,
  `createTestStore()` (in-memory BundleStore)

### `@dev/source` custom export condition

Package.json exports use a custom `@dev/source` condition so that
TypeScript source (`.ts`) is resolved during development, while compiled
`.js` dist paths are used in production:

```jsonc
// package.json
"exports": {
  ".": {
    "@dev/source": "./index.ts",     // ← resolved in dev (via tsconfig)
    "types": "./dist/index.d.ts",
    "import": "./dist/index.js"      // ← resolved in production
  }
}
```

This is enabled by `customConditions: ["@dev/source"]` in the root
`tsconfig.json`. During dev, imports like `import { X } from "@alexkroman1/aai"`
resolve directly to `.ts` source — no build step needed.

### Import rules

- **Cross-package imports** must use the npm package name (e.g.
  `import { X } from "@alexkroman1/aai/protocol"`), never relative paths between
  packages. Biome's `noRestrictedImports` enforces this.
- **Internal modules** (`_*.ts`) must not be imported from outside their
  own package. Biome's `noPrivateImports` enforces this.
- **Re-exports**: barrel files use `export * from "..."` with explicit
  `biome-ignore` comments. Follow re-export chains to find the original
  source of a type/function.

### Disambiguating "Session" types

Multiple types named `Session` or `Session*` exist across packages —
they are **not interchangeable**:

| Type | Package | File | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `SessionCore` | `aai` | `host/session-core.ts` | Server-side session — bridges a `Transport` (S2S, pipeline, or OpenAI Realtime) to the client protocol |
| `SessionCoreOptions` | `aai` | `host/session-core.ts` | Config for creating the server-side session core |
| `SttSession` / `TtsSession` | `aai` | `sdk/providers.ts` | Host-side handle to one open STT/TTS provider stream (pipeline mode) |
| `SessionCore` | `aai-ui` | `session-core.ts` | Framework-agnostic browser session (WebSocket + audio + state) |
| `SessionSnapshot` | `aai-ui` | `session-core.ts` | Immutable snapshot of browser session state (for `useSyncExternalStore`) |
| `SessionError` | `aai-ui` | `types.ts` | Client-side error type with error code |

When searching for "Session", narrow by package to find the right one.

### Subpath export → file mapping

Tracing imports through barrel files can be confusing. Here's the map
of subpath exports in `aai/package.json`:

| Import path | Resolves to | What it contains |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `@alexkroman1/aai` | `packages/aai/index.ts` → 6 modules | Types, Db, utils, constants, `agent()`/`tool()` helpers |
| `@alexkroman1/aai/utils` | `sdk/utils.ts` (direct, not a barrel) | Zod-free utilities (`errorMessage`, `errorDetail`, …) + the slug contract (`VALID_SLUG_RE`, `RESERVED_SLUGS` from `sdk/slug.ts`). Deliberately dependency-free so the CLI can load it on every invocation without paying zod's startup cost |
| `@alexkroman1/aai/runtime` | `host/runtime-barrel.ts` → 11 modules | Full Node.js runtime: session, S2S, server, tools, WS handler |
| `@alexkroman1/aai/protocol` | `sdk/protocol.ts` (direct, not a barrel) | Wire-format Zod schemas, `lenientParse()`, `ClientEvent`, `ServerMessage` |
| `@alexkroman1/aai/manifest` | `sdk/manifest-barrel.ts` → 3 modules | `parseManifest()`, `toAgentConfig()`, `agentToolsToSchemas()`, system prompt builder |
| `@alexkroman1/aai/stt` | `host/providers/stt-barrel.ts` | STT provider factories + types (`assemblyAI`, `deepgram`, `elevenlabs`, `soniox`) |
| `@alexkroman1/aai/llm` | `host/providers/llm-barrel.ts` | LLM provider factories + types (`anthropic`, `openai`, `google`, `mistral`, `xai`, `groq`, `openrouter`, `gateway`) |
| `@alexkroman1/aai/tts` | `host/providers/tts-barrel.ts` | TTS provider factories + types (`cartesia`, `rime`, `assemblyAI`) |

### Concurrency primitives (use these, don't hand-roll)

The codebase's recurring async-coordination patterns are reified as small
primitives — reach for them before re-inventing the pattern at a call site:

- **`createEpoch()`** (`aai/sdk/epoch.ts`, exported from `@alexkroman1/aai`) —
  staleness guard for async continuations: capture `current()` when deferring
  work, check `isCurrent(gen)` when it settles, `bump()` to invalidate.
  Adopted by the aai-ui connection/turn generations and the pipeline turn
  gate. Don't hand-roll `let generation = 0; generation++` counters.
- **`createOwnedMap()`** (`aai/sdk/owned-map.ts`, exported from
  `@alexkroman1/aai`) — a map whose entries are removed by ownership token:
  `claim(key, value)` returns the only release for that claim, so an async
  teardown settling after the key was re-claimed (reconnect resume, redeploy)
  can't evict the successor's entry. `owns()` guards non-delete mutations.
  Adopted by the runtime's `sessions`/`sinkMap`, the WS handler, and the
  platform `SlotCache`. Don't write `if (map.get(k) === mine) map.delete(k)`
  by hand.
- **`createTurnMachine()`** (`aai/host/transports/pipeline-turn-state.ts`) —
  the pipeline transport's turn lifecycle (in-flight reply, spoke flag, TTS
  audio gate) as a discriminated-union machine whose named transitions are
  the only mutation path. New turn-state reads/writes go through it, not new
  closure flags.
- **Timeouts**: use `p-timeout` (a dependency of aai, aai-cli, and
  aai-server) — never a hand-rolled `Promise.race` with a timer; the losing
  branch's late rejection and timer cleanup are exactly what gets re-derived
  wrong. The one exception is the guest harness's `withTimeout`
  (`aai-guest/harness-rpc.ts`), which stays local because the bundled harness
  imports no npm packages.
- **Combining abort signals**: use native `AbortSignal.any([...])` (sources
  held weakly — no unlink bookkeeping); the pipeline transport combines the
  session signal with each turn's controller this way.

### Default values and magic numbers

All numeric constants live in `packages/aai/sdk/constants.ts` (client-audio
budgets are split into `sdk/client-audio-constants.ts` for file-length reasons
and re-exported from `constants.ts`, so the import path is unchanged). Key
defaults that affect agent behavior:

| Default | Value | Where applied | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `maxSteps` | 10 (`DEFAULT_MAX_STEPS`) | `constants.ts` | Max tool calls per reply. Prevents runaway tool loops; sized so multi-tool chains plus a repair retry fit. |
| `toolChoice` | `"auto"` | `manifest.ts:59` | LLM decides when to use tools vs respond directly. |
| `idleTimeoutMs` | 300,000 (5 min) | `constants.ts:26` | `0` or non-finite disables the timer entirely. |
| `silenceTimeoutMs` | unset (disabled) | `pipeline-silence.ts` | Pipeline only: assistant proactively takes a turn after this much user silence. Capped at `MAX_CONSECUTIVE_SILENCE_NUDGES` (3) back-to-back nudges until the user speaks again. `silencePrompt` customizes the injected instruction (default `DEFAULT_SILENCE_PROMPT`); it is kept in LLM history but never emitted as a user transcript. |
| `minBargeInWords` | 2 (`DEFAULT_MIN_BARGE_IN_WORDS`) | `constants.ts` | Pipeline only: interim-transcript words before user speech interrupts the in-flight reply. 2 keeps one-word backchannels from cutting the agent off; sub-threshold finals are answered after the reply. |
| `interruptionMinDurationMs` | 500 (`DEFAULT_INTERRUPTION_MIN_DURATION_MS`) | `constants.ts` | Pipeline only: sustained speech (ms since the utterance's first partial) required before an interim-triggered barge-in fires — LiveKit's `min_interruption_duration` analog. Non-zero by default: room noise and echo of the agent's own voice produce short interim transcripts, and each one used to abandon a reply mid-word. Finals are never gated. 0 disables. |
| AssemblyAI `min_turn_silence` | 1500 (`DEFAULT_MIN_TURN_SILENCE_MS`) | `host/providers/stt/assemblyai.ts` | End-of-turn silence before the service commits a `final`. Endpointing lives in the STT provider — the pipeline transport commits a turn on every final — so this is what keeps a mid-utterance pause from splitting one request across turns. Override via `assemblyAI({ minTurnSilenceMs })`. |
| Deepgram `endpointing` | 1500 (`DEFAULT_DEEPGRAM_ENDPOINTING_MS`) | `sdk/providers/stt/deepgram.ts` | Same role as `min_turn_silence` above — the provider owns end-of-turn; override via `deepgram({ endpointing })`. |
| `holdPhrase` | `"One moment."` (`DEFAULT_HOLD_PHRASE`) | `pipeline-stream.ts` | Pipeline only: spoken when a turn opens with a tool call and no speech. `""` disables. |
| `errorPhrase` | `"Sorry, I had a problem just then. Could you say that again?"` (`DEFAULT_ERROR_PHRASE`) | `pipeline-turn-outcome.ts` | Pipeline only: spoken when the turn's LLM stream fails, so a provider outage hands the conversation back instead of going silent. A failed turn produces no text, so nothing would otherwise reach TTS and the only trace is a `llm` session error the browser surfaces without a sound. `""` disables. |
| dead-air cover | 2000 ms (`DEFAULT_DEAD_AIR_COVER_MS`) | `pipeline-stream.ts` | Pipeline only: tool execution that sends nothing to TTS for this long gets a `DEAD_AIR_COVER_PHRASES` filler — unlike `holdPhrase` this is time-based, so it still fires after the model has spoken, and repeats across a tool chain with the wait doubling each time. `holdPhrase: ""` disables both. |
| `falseInterruptionTimeoutMs` | 2000 (`DEFAULT_FALSE_INTERRUPTION_TIMEOUT_MS`) | `constants.ts` | Pipeline only: a partial-triggered barge-in that never commits a user turn (STT noise) resumes the interrupted reply via a synthetic continuation turn after this window. A mid-turn cut resumes from the `[interrupted]` history marker (`DEFAULT_FALSE_INTERRUPTION_PROMPT`); a cut during the client playback tail — the reply finished server-side but was still playing out — resumes with a prompt quoting the estimated last-heard words (`buildTailResumePrompt`), unless less than `TAIL_RESUME_MIN_UNHEARD_MS` of audio was unheard. 0 disables. |
| `maxHistory` | 200 | `constants.ts:52` | Sliding window of conversation messages retained. |
| resume grace | 120,000 (`SESSION_RESUME_GRACE_MS`) | `constants.ts` | How long a disconnected session's per-session tool state (`ctx.state`) survives awaiting a `?sessionId=<id>` resume — the runtime's stateMap sweep (in-guest on the platform, in-process under `aai dev`) waits it out, cancelled when the session resumes. Sized above the browser client's worst-case automatic-reconnect span (~105s); the client reconnects with the sessionId from the `config` frame, so the resumed session finds its state under the same key. |
| `builtinTools` | `DEFAULT_BUILTIN_TOOLS` (`think`, `remember`, `recall`, `calculate`) | `constants.ts` | Cognitive built-ins on by default: private reasoning scratchpad, session notes, safe calculator. Set `builtinTools` explicitly (including `[]`) to override. `web_search`/`visit_webpage`/`get_page_design`/`fetch_json`/`run_code` remain opt-in. A custom or relayed tool with the same name wins — the built-in is dropped. |

### Fixed release coupling

`aai`, `aai-ui`, and `aai-cli` are in a **fixed release group** (configured
in `.changeset/config.json`). A changeset for any one of them bumps all
three to the same version. Keep this in mind when creating changesets —
you only need to list one package.

### Testing

- **Vitest**. Test files co-located: `foo.ts` → `foo.test.ts`.
- **The aai-server test project auto-builds the guest harness**:
  `scripts/ensure-guest-harness.mjs` runs as vitest `globalSetup` (root and
  per-package configs) and builds `aai-guest` when `dist/harness.mjs` is
  missing or older than the guest package's sources — `createSandbox`
  resolves it eagerly, so an unbuilt harness otherwise fails every sandbox
  test. Staleness tracks aai-guest sources only (not the bundled SDK);
  `GUEST_HARNESS_PATH` skips the check. The same script also runs as
  `predev` in aai-server and aai-studio-server (so `pnpm dev:aai-server`
  always boots with a fresh harness for local-dev sandboxes) and
  as `predeploy:modal` in both server packages (a fail-fast before the
  remote Modal image build, which rebuilds the harness itself). Also
  runnable directly: `node scripts/ensure-guest-harness.mjs`.
- **Each suite is defined once, in its own package's `vitest.config.ts`.**
  The root `vitest.config.ts` discovers them with `projects: ["packages/*"]`
  and adds only the typecheck-only `aai-types` project. Use
  `--project <name>` to run one; the name is declared in the package config
  (a bare glob would otherwise name the project after package.json, e.g.
  `@alexkroman1/aai`). Do NOT re-declare a suite at the root: it used to
  hold a second inline copy of all eight, and they silently drifted — the
  aai-cli copy lost `_test-setup.ts`, so `--project aai-cli` ran the CLI
  suite against the developer's real `~/.config/aai/config.json`; the server
  copies lost their 20s argon2 timeout; the aai-server excludes named two
  deleted files while missing a live integration test; and the templates
  copy skipped two of its four test files.
- Slow/integration tests have separate per-package configs
  (`vitest.slow.config.ts`, `vitest.integration.config.ts`) to avoid running
  during `vitest run`.
- In tests, use `flush()` from `_test-utils.ts` instead of
  `await new Promise(r => setTimeout(r, 0))` to yield to microtasks.
- Use `vi.waitFor()` instead of arbitrary delays when polling for async results.
- Type-level tests use `.test-d.ts` files with `typecheck: { only: true }`
  — they are checked by tsc but never executed at runtime. Use
  `expectTypeOf` from vitest to assert on type shapes. Projects:
  `aai-types`.
- **Package validation**: `publint` runs post-build to verify package.json
  exports resolve to real files. `attw` validates export types. Both run in
  the check pipeline AND in CI, and **all three publishable packages
  (`aai`, `aai-ui`, `aai-cli`) must define both scripts** — for a long time
  only `aai-ui` did, leaving `aai`'s ten subpath exports ungated. That is
  the gap the deleted npm/yarn e2e legs were retired *in favour of* (see
  "The e2e suite is pnpm-only in CI"), so it has to actually hold.
- **Typechecking covers test files**, because every package's tsconfig
  includes them. Turbo's `typecheck` task must therefore keep `**/*.test.ts`
  in its `inputs`: excluding them (as it once did) meant a type error in a
  test could not invalidate the cache, and `turbo run typecheck` replayed a
  green FULL TURBO while `tsc --noEmit` failed.
- **Coverage**: `pnpm test:coverage` (root or per package) runs vitest with
  v8 coverage and enforces the per-package threshold ratchet (see
  "Quality ratchets" above). CI runs it for every package in the test
  matrix, so a PR that drops coverage below a package's floor fails.

#### Vitest config differences per package

| Package | Pool | Environment | Special setup | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| aai | threads (default) | node | — | Excludes pentest, sandbox, integration tests; `restoreMocks: true` |
| aai-ui | threads | **jsdom** | `_jsdom-setup.ts` (stubs `scrollIntoView`) | `globals: true` so `describe`/`test`/`expect` don't need imports |
| aai-cli | threads | node | — | `restoreMocks: true` |
| aai-server | **forks** | node | — | Forks for process isolation; excludes integration tests |
| aai-studio-client | threads | node | — | `.tsx` tests via `react-dom/server` (no jsdom) |
| aai-templates | threads | node | — | Also matches `templates.test.ts` + `template-api-coverage.test.ts` |

#### Test environment variables

Tests can behave differently based on environment variables set in
package.json scripts (not always obvious from test code alone):

- `VITEST_PROFILE` — switches timeout/retry profiles in
  `vitest.slow.config.ts`: `integration` (30s), `e2e` (300s)
- `VITEST_INCLUDE` — filters which test files to include
- `VITEST_POOL` — can override pool strategy at runtime
- `AAI_TEST_PM` — package manager the e2e suite installs the scaffolded
  project with (`pnpm` | `npm` | `yarn`; default `pnpm`). **CI only runs
  `pnpm`** — see below.

#### Studio starter evals (scripts/starter-eval.mjs)

The LLM-judge codegen suite (`studio-eval.test.ts`, vitest-evals) was
removed in favour of a harness that drives the studio's REAL surface —
create project, broker a sandbox session, stream a chat turn to the guest —
rather than calling the codegen path directly:

```sh
node scripts/starter-eval.mjs [--only <substring>] [--repeat N] [--out f.json]
node scripts/starter-eval-report.mjs run.json [baseline.json]
```

It spends real tokens on the caller's own key, so it is not in CI. Three
things it measures that the judge suite did not:

- **Shippable, not just green.** The agent writes its own tests, so "the
  tests passed" is a measure it can satisfy by weakening an assertion. The
  primary verdict is instead whether the built agent covers the capabilities
  the PROMPT enumerated (`scripts/starter-expectations.mjs`), checked
  against the loaded config and agent.ts — neither of which the agent can
  edit to make the check pass.
- **Cost**: tool calls, repair rounds (failed `test_agent` runs), wall
  clock. Repair rounds are the number worth optimizing; they were what the
  starter prompts actually burned their step budget on.
- **A failure taxonomy** — never-verified / verified-broken / missing
  capability / step-capped — because "RED" was hiding three problems that
  want three different fixes.

**Run-to-run variance is large, and single runs cannot adjudicate a prompt
change.** Measured on one starter with an identical config: tool calls
varied 9–14 and repairs 1–4, which is the size of the effect most prompt
edits produce. Use `--repeat 3` and compare arms, and expect a plausible
change to show no effect — one A/B of a TypeScript-idioms preamble block
came back flat and the block was removed rather than kept on the strength
of a single flattering run.

What the deleted suite did that this does not: an LLM judge scoring the
workspace against a reference template for persona, state use, and assets
(`TemplateParityJudge`). Capability coverage is checked; resemblance to a
hand-written template is not.

#### The e2e suite is pnpm-only in CI

`aai init` scaffolds a project that the e2e suite then installs from a mock
registry, so the install step can in principle run under any package
manager. CI used to fan that out (`pm: [pnpm, npm, yarn]` × 2 OSes = 6
jobs); it now runs pnpm alone.

The npm/yarn legs were paying for themselves in flakes rather than bugs:
each one is a full cold install of the published tarballs on a shared
runner, they tripped over resolver-specific quirks unrelated to our code
(hence `--no-lockfile`, `--no-strict-peer-dependencies`,
`NPM_CONFIG_MINIMUM_RELEASE_AGE=0`), and the repo itself is pnpm-only, so
the thing they guarded — "our published `exports` maps resolve under a
non-pnpm resolver" — is better served by `publint` + `attw`, which run on
every build and check the package metadata directly.

The `AAI_TEST_PM` switch in `_e2e-test-utils.ts` stays, so an npm or yarn
install is one env var away when reproducing a user report:

```sh
AAI_TEST_PM=npm pnpm test:e2e
```

Treat those two branches as a debugging tool, not covered ground.

#### Fixture replay testing (aai/host)

Tests in `packages/aai/host/` use a **hybrid mock** pattern: a real
`Runtime` and tool executor with mocked S2S WebSocket connections. JSON
fixtures in `host/fixtures/` contain recorded AssemblyAI API messages
that are replayed through the real orchestration layer. Key helpers:

- `makeMockHandle()` — creates mock S2S WebSocket using nanoevents
- `replayFixtureMessages()` — dispatches fixture JSON as typed events
- `createFixtureSession()` — wires a real Runtime to mocked S2S

### Changesets

This repo uses [@changesets/cli](https://github.com/changesets/changesets)
to track version bumps. Every PR that changes code in `packages/` **must**
include a changeset file (enforced by the pre-push hook).

**Creating a changeset (interactive — preferred for humans):**

```sh
pnpm changeset          # Prompts for packages + bump type + summary
```

**Creating a changeset (non-interactive — for agents/CI):**

```sh
pnpm changeset:create --pkg @alexkroman1/aai --bump patch --summary "Fix typo in error message"
```

Multiple packages:

```sh
pnpm changeset:create --pkg @alexkroman1/aai --pkg @alexkroman1/aai-ui --bump minor --summary "Add new session API"
```

If the change doesn't need a release (docs-only, config, tests):

```sh
pnpm changeset add --empty
```

**Changeset file format** (`.changeset/<random-name>.md`):

```yaml
---
"@alexkroman1/aai": patch
---

Short summary of the change for the changelog.
```

Valid bump types: `patch` (bug fixes), `minor` (new features), `major`
(breaking changes).

**Fixed packages:** `@alexkroman1/aai`, `@alexkroman1/aai-ui`, and
`@alexkroman1/aai-cli` release together (configured in
`.changeset/config.json`). You only need to list one; the others are
bumped automatically.

**Checking status:** `pnpm changeset status --since=origin/main`

### Related docs

- **Templates**: `packages/aai-templates/templates/` contains agent
  scaffolding templates (simple, web-researcher, etc.). Each is
  self-contained with its own `agent.ts` and optional `client.tsx`.
  `scaffold/` has base project files (package.json, tsconfig,
  etc.) layered underneath.

### Git hooks (lefthook)

- **pre-commit**: runs `biome check --write` on staged files and
  `syncpack lint` when package.json changes.
- **pre-push**: blocks pushes to main/master, **blocks pushes when branch
  is behind origin/main** (must rebase first), checks for merge conflicts
  with main, **verifies changeset exists for changed packages**, and runs
  `pnpm check`.

### Worktree gotchas

- Run `unset GIT_DIR` before `pnpm changeset status` in worktrees
  (lefthook sets GIT_DIR which confuses changeset's repo detection).
- Always use `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` in worktrees to avoid
  modifying the lockfile. Fall back to `pnpm install` only if frozen
  fails (new deps added on the branch).
- Never edit `pnpm-lock.yaml` directly — always use `pnpm install`.

### Stateless server (aai-server)

The platform server holds no cross-request durable or coordination state in
process — any replica can serve any request, and a replica restart loses
nothing but live control-channel connections (voice sessions don't pass
through it at all). Everything durable lives in Supabase (bundles and
client files in Storage, agent env + app-db credentials in Vault, studio
workspaces/chats and per-app data in Postgres), and cross-replica
coordination lives in the same Postgres over `SUPABASE_DB_URL`:

- **Per-slug mutation lock** (`platform-lock.ts`): deploy/delete/secret/
  storage mutations for a slug run under a lease row in
  `aai_platform.slug_locks` (`createPgSlugLock`), injected as the `slugLock`
  binding. A lease table, not a Postgres advisory lock — advisory locks are
  connection-scoped and `SqlExec` runs over a pool, so acquire and release
  could land on different connections; a lease survives any connection and
  expires on its own if the holder crashes. The Postgres lock still takes
  the in-process `withSlugLock` first (local waiters queue on the mutex
  instead of polling the database), and it is **not renewed while held** —
  an operation outrunning `SLUG_LOCK_LEASE_MS` loses exclusivity. Contention
  past the acquire deadline surfaces as `SlugLockTimeoutError` → 409.
  `sandbox-resolve.ts` stays on the in-process lock deliberately: it guards
  this replica's slot cache, a legitimately process-local resource.

  **The binding is wrapped in `createMutationLock`, and must stay wrapped:
  taking the lock also drops this replica's cached view of the slug.** The
  lease alone is not enough, because every mutation is a read-modify-write
  over a read-through cache — `handleSecretSet` merges onto `getEnv`,
  `deployLocked` merges the stored env *and* `credential_hashes` off
  `getManifest` — and `putEnv` drops only the writing replica's entry. A
  write that landed on replica A is invisible to replica B for the 60s
  manifest TTL, so B computes its merge from a pre-lock snapshot and writes
  the older value back. The two writes were serialized perfectly and one of
  them still vanished, silently: a secret reverts, or a deploy drops a
  co-owner's credential hash. Invalidation belongs at lock acquisition (one
  place, in `platform-lock.ts`) rather than per route, for the same reason
  `invalidateSlug` exists — a route that forgets produces no error at all.
  Note the broker path deliberately does NOT go through this wrapper, so
  brokering a session never drops the up-to-30 MB worker-code cache.
- **Studio rate limits** (`aai-studio-server/studio-rate-limit.ts`): the
  chat and project-create windows are rows in
  `aai_platform.studio_rate_limits` (`createPgRateLimiter`, one atomic
  upsert per check), so the limit holds platform-wide instead of
  multiplying by the replica count. Fail-closed: a database error
  propagates rather than silently unmetering the LLM-proxy route.
- **Session resume needs no cross-replica store**: sessions live in the
  guest sandbox, not on a replica — a `?sessionId=<id>` reconnect
  re-brokers via `GET /:slug/client-config` and lands on the SAME sandbox,
  whose in-guest runtime holds the state through the resume grace window.
  (The old host-side session-state persistence died with the host relay.)

What deliberately stays in-process, and why it doesn't break statelessness:

- **The slot cache, sandboxes, and warm pool** — a resident sandbox is a
  per-replica accelerator; slug epochs (below) keep residents correct
  across replicas, and losing them costs a rebuild, never correctness.
- **Caches** (bundle-store manifest/worker/client caches, the auth hash
  cache, the studio build cache) — TTL-bounded or content-hash-keyed
  read-through caches whose staleness windows are documented at each site.
- **The in-process workspace/slug mutexes** — kept *under* the distributed
  mechanisms so local writer fan-out doesn't burn the cross-replica
  retry/lease on itself.

### Split services (aai-server / aai-studio-server)

Two packages, one surface each. `aai-server` is the AGENT service plus the
shared platform core (stores, locks, epochs, sandbox machinery — exported to
the sibling via `"./*": "./*.ts"` exports; `platform-barrel.ts` is the
sanctioned path to its `_`-internal utilities). `aai-studio-server` is the
STUDIO service; its entry also hosts the `combined` composition
(`AAI_SERVICE` combined|studio — a path dispatcher over both apps, which is
what `pnpm dev:aai-server` and pre-split deployments run). Deploys are
per-service Modal apps (`aai-server-web`, `aai-studio-web`, each package's
`modal_deploy.py`). The split exists because the two workloads scale
differently — studio chat turns are LLM-bound and bursty, the agent
service's control work is light — and one container served both badly.

- **One public origin.** Browsers only ever talk to the agent service; in
  `agent` mode it reverse-proxies `/`, `/favicon.ico`, `/studio-assets/*`,
  and `/studio/*` to `STUDIO_UPSTREAM_URL` (`studio-proxy.ts` — streaming
  passthrough, SSE included). This is what keeps the preview iframe working:
  agent pages are served `X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN`, so the studio must
  share their origin. The proxy forwards identity-encoded (drops
  `accept-encoding`) because undici's fetch decompresses bodies but leaves
  `content-encoding` headers in place. Shared base middleware lives in
  `app-middleware.ts` so the two apps can't drift on CORS/framing policy.
- **Never derive the public scheme from the request URL** — use
  `resolvePublicOrigin` (`aai-server/public-origin.ts`). Modal terminates TLS
  at its edge and forwards plain HTTP to the container (its ASGI proxy adds
  only `X-Forwarded-For`, never `X-Forwarded-Proto`), so `new URL(c.req.url)`
  is **always** `http:` in a handler, whatever the browser used. Resolution
  order: `AAI_PUBLIC_ORIGIN` → `x-forwarded-host`/`-proto` (a real proxy in
  front, including this platform's own studio proxy, which sets both *from
  this resolver*) → infer, loopback being the only `http`.

  Both places that had rolled their own cost real outages. Studio **Publish
  died on `401 Missing Authorization header` from its own platform**: the
  guest was handed `http://<public host>`, its `aai deploy` POST was
  308-redirected to `https://`, and `fetch` strips `Authorization` across a
  scheme change (different origin per the Fetch spec). The request arrived
  unauthenticated, so the CLI reported an invalid API key it had in fact sent
  correctly — and the studio proxy's own `x-forwarded-proto: http` propagated
  the same wrong answer into split mode. The bare-slug redirect
  (`/:slug` → `/:slug/`) separately echoed the cleartext URL back as an
  absolute `Location`, bouncing https browsers through `http://`; it is now
  relative, which no scheme can taint.
- **Cross-service invalidation is slug epochs** (`platform-epoch.ts`,
  `aai_platform.slug_epochs`). A local `terminateSlot`/`restartSlotSandbox`
  only fixes the replica that handled the mutation; every deploy/delete/
  secret/storage mutation therefore also bumps the slug's epoch, and
  `resolveSandbox` compares the resident sandbox's build epoch — a mismatch
  terminates it, drops the bundle-store caches (`BundleStore.invalidate`),
  and rebuilds from the freshly stored bundle. This is how a studio-service
  Publish reaches the agent service's resident sandboxes. Bumps are
  best-effort after the write (`bumpSlugEpoch` warns, never fails the
  mutation); epoch reads degrade to "current" so a broker request never
  dies on the invalidation check. A client re-brokers on reconnect, so a
  replaced sandbox heals with one reconnect.
- **The studio service holds an always-empty slot cache** — the shared
  mutation cores' local sandbox restarts are deliberate no-ops there, while
  their epoch bumps do the real work. It shares everything else through
  Supabase and spawns its own Modal sandboxes for `test_agent`/config
  extraction (its own warm pool via `SANDBOX_POOL_SIZE`).
- **The web service autoscales** (constants block in `modal_deploy.py`),
  bounded by `MIN_CONTAINERS`/`MAX_CONTAINERS`. Voice sessions don't pass
  through the service, so scale-in and redeploys never cut a call — a
  draining replica only drops control channels, and the guest's orphan
  timeout plus re-brokering cover replacement.

### Modal sandbox notes

- **Two backends, selected by `sandbox-backend.ts`.** Guest sandboxes are
  **remote Modal Sandboxes** (`modal-sandbox.ts`) in production and a plain
  **child process** (`subprocess-sandbox.ts`) in local dev. The policy is
  three rules: an explicit `SANDBOX_BACKEND` (`modal` | `subprocess`) always
  wins (unknown values throw — a silent fallback would look like the override
  not working); otherwise not-local-dev → `modal`, unconditionally; otherwise
  → `subprocess`. `isLocalDev` is false whenever `SUPABASE_S3_ENDPOINT` is
  set, so **production can never resolve the host-local backend**, and fails
  loudly without `MODAL_TOKEN_ID`/`MODAL_TOKEN_SECRET` (or a `~/.modal.toml`
  profile) rather than degrading. There is **no fallback between backends at
  spawn time**: a failed spawn is a failed spawn.
- **Two tiers, and deliberately no middle one.** A local-container backend
  (Apple's `container` CLI) sat between these and was removed. The reasoning
  is worth keeping, because "run a real container locally" keeps sounding
  like the obvious answer: it could never give production confidence — only
  `SANDBOX_BACKEND=modal` can, since that IS production — while it cost a
  second delivery mechanism for the in-guest build toolchain (Modal bakes one
  into its snapshot image; a local container needs an equivalent built and
  mounted) and invented failure modes that exist in no other environment. Two
  of those cost real debugging time: a linux guest cannot load the host's
  darwin-installed native binaries (vite/rolldown, lightningcss — everything
  *resolves*, then fails to *load*), and a loopback platform origin points at
  the guest's own harness rather than the dev server, so Publish 404s against
  itself. So: `subprocess` for fast iteration, `modal` when the question is
  "does this really work". A stale `SANDBOX_BACKEND=apple-container` throws
  at boot.
- **Subprocess backend (the local-dev default)** — `subprocess-sandbox.ts`
  runs the harness as a child process of the server on a loopback port. It
  has **no isolation at all**: tenant agent code, and the studio coding
  agent's `bash`/`run_code` tools, run with the server's uid, filesystem, and
  network. That is only acceptable because selection can never reach it in
  production, and boot says so unconditionally
  (`assertSandboxBackendOrWarn` logs the backend plus an isolation warning).
  It keeps the *shape* that catches integration bugs — a real OS process, the
  real `/ws` JSON-RPC control channel, the real `bundle/load`, real
  `/websocket` sessions, real dial-retry and orphan-timeout behavior — and it
  has no prerequisites, which is the whole point of it being the default.
  The harness binds **loopback** via `AAI_GUEST_HOST` (see
  `aai-guest/harness.ts`): with no network namespace around it, the auth-free
  `/websocket` would otherwise be exposed to the dev machine's network.
  In-guest builds resolve the toolchain through aai-guest's own
  `node_modules` — the same walk-up shape as `/opt/aai` in the baked image,
  with no cache to build. The shared harness lifecycle (exit fan-out,
  memoized cleanup, guest dial retry, stdio draining, loopback port
  allocation) lives in `warm-harness.ts`, used by both backends.
- The guest base image defaults to `node:24-slim`; pin via
  `MODAL_SANDBOX_IMAGE` for reproducible guests. `MODAL_APP_NAME` selects the
  Modal App sandboxes are created under (default `aai-server`).
- **The harness AND the build toolchain are baked into a snapshot image**,
  not written per spawn: a throwaway builder sandbox writes the harness,
  `npm install`s the guest build toolchain next to it (`/opt/aai/
  node_modules` — the aai CLI bundlers plus the workspace-facing packages;
  versions come from aai-guest's own dependency declarations, `workspace:*`
  pinned to the installed versions, so dev and baked toolchains share one
  source of truth), its filesystem is snapshotted (`snapshotFilesystem`),
  and the image is `publish`ed under a content-addressed tag
  (`aai-guest-harness:<hash(base image, harness, toolchain)>`), so every
  later spawn — and every other replica, across restarts — resolves it with
  one `images.fromName` call. A new harness build, base-image change, or
  toolchain bump mints a new tag. This is the only harness-delivery path; a
  failed build fails the spawn loudly (memo cleared, next spawn retries).
  Only the Modal backend needs this: the subprocess backend's harness runs
  from `packages/aai-guest/dist/` and resolves the toolchain through
  aai-guest's own `node_modules` — the same walk-up shape as `/opt/aai`, with
  nothing to build or mount. The `workspace-build-integration.test.ts` suite
  keeps the path covered on any runner by spawning the harness there directly
  and publishing through the real CLI to a real listening orchestrator.
- Sandboxes are created with open egress and a bounded lifetime
  (`SANDBOX_TIMEOUT_SECS`, default 4h). Memory/CPU caps come from
  `SANDBOX_MEMORY_LIMIT_MB` / `SANDBOX_CPU_LIMIT`.
- **Transport is a WebSocket the host dials through the sandbox's Modal
  tunnel** (`encryptedPorts: [8080]`): the harness serves JSON-RPC on `/ws`,
  authenticated by a per-sandbox bearer token minted at spawn and delivered
  via the EXEC's env (never the sandbox's). The tunnel URL is public; the
  token is what keeps it from being an open door. The dial retries while the
  harness server boots (`GUEST_DIAL_TIMEOUT_MS`).
- **Region pinning**: `MODAL_SANDBOX_REGION` (comma-separated for multiple)
  pins sandbox placement via Modal's `regions` create param. Unpinned, Modal
  places for capacity — it once put the server in us-east-1/AWS and guest
  sandboxes in uk-london-1/OCI, so every host↔guest RPC (ctx.db,
  guest fetch proxy, `bundle/load`) paid a transatlantic RTT inside voice
  turns. `modal_deploy.py` pins its functions to one `REGION` constant and
  exports it as `MODAL_SANDBOX_REGION`, so production host and guests are
  co-located by construction; local dev stays unpinned.
- **Orphan cleanup: the host's WebSocket IS the liveness signal.** A host
  that dies without running `shutdown()`'s teardown (crash, OOM, SIGKILL
  past the drain deadline) drops its sockets; the harness self-exits after
  `HARNESS_ORPHAN_TIMEOUT_MS` with no host connected (`aai-guest/harness.ts`,
  constants in `aai-guest/limits.ts` — the window also covers the boot gap
  before the first dial). Once the exec has exited, Modal's `idleTimeoutMs`
  (`SANDBOX_IDLE_TIMEOUT_SECS`, default 15 min) terminates the sandbox.
  There is no heartbeat protocol — connection presence replaces it.
  Host-side eviction (`sandbox-slots.ts`) stays the authority on
  session-aware idleness — sessions connect directly to the sandbox, so the
  idle timer asks the guest (`status` RPC → live session count) before
  killing; a dead/unreachable guest answers 0 and is reclaimed.
- The server itself deploys to Modal too (`modal_deploy.py`,
  `pnpm --filter aai-server deploy:modal`) — there is no Docker image or
  Fly.io deployment anymore.

### Updating CLAUDE.md

When you make changes that affect architecture, security model, conventions,
or gotchas, update this file.

## PR workflow

**Default:** When finishing a development branch, always push and create a
Pull Request (don't ask — just do it).

**Before pushing**, rebase on the latest `main` to avoid merge conflicts:

```sh
git fetch origin main
git rebase origin/main
```

The pre-push hook will automatically check for conflicts with `main` and
block the push if any are found. This prevents PRs from being opened with
merge conflicts.

Run `pnpm check:local` **before your first commit** on a PR branch. This
catches the most common issues that historically required follow-up commits:

1. **Syncpack version drift**: When bumping a dependency, also update
   `packages/aai-templates/scaffold/package.json` if it has the same dep.
   Note syncpack does NOT check the scaffold (it is excluded in
   `.syncpackrc.json`) — run `node scripts/sync-scaffold-versions.mjs`
   to sync it (or `--check` to verify).
2. **Test assertion mismatches**: After changing output formats or error
   messages, run `pnpm test` and update affected assertions.
3. **Lint in related files**: Pre-commit only lints staged files. Run
   `pnpm lint` to catch lint issues in files affected by your change.
4. **Type-level tests**: After changing public API types (`parseManifest`,
   `Manifest`, etc.), run `pnpm vitest run --project aai-types`
   to verify type contracts haven't regressed. Update `.test-d.ts` files
   if the change is intentional.
5. **Dependencies orphaned by a deletion**: removing the last consumer of a
   package leaves the `devDependencies` entry and its lockfile tree behind.
   `pnpm check:knip` catches this and is in the local subset for that
   reason — it's the one failure you won't notice while working, because
   deleting code puts your attention on what goes away, not on what the
   removal strands. When a PR deletes a directory, expect a dependency to
   come out with it.

## Security architecture

### Modal sandbox isolation

Each agent runs in its own **Modal Sandbox** — a remote, isolated container
on Modal's infrastructure (`modal-sandbox.ts`). The guest runs a Node
process executing the bundled agent code (`aai-guest/harness.ts`) — the
COMPLETE agent: the runtime ships INSIDE the worker bundle (see
"User-shipped runtime" — the harness embeds none), and client sessions
connect directly to the sandbox's public `/session` tunnel endpoint.
Host↔guest control traffic is JSON-RPC over a WebSocket the host dials
through the same tunnel (`/ws`), authenticated by a per-sandbox bearer
token.

**In production.** Local dev defaults to the `subprocess` backend, which has
**none** of the properties described below — the harness is a child process
of the server, sharing its uid, filesystem, and network — see "Modal sandbox
notes". Selection (`sandbox-backend.ts`) makes it unreachable outside local
dev: any environment with `SUPABASE_S3_ENDPOINT` set resolves `modal`
unconditionally. When reasoning about the security model, the backend is the
first thing to establish, and the boot log names it (with a warning when
there is no boundary at all).

Key properties:

- **Remote isolation**: each sandbox is its own container on Modal — no
  shared kernel surface with the platform host, no shared state between
  agents. The container is the security boundary; the guest runs plain Node
  (no language-runtime permission model).
- **Open egress**: the container is the isolation boundary — a tenant can
  reach the internet, not the platform. Tool code, `ctx.generate`, and
  provider streams dial out from the guest directly (identical to
  `aai dev`); `ctx.db` stays host-proxied RPC so platform database
  credentials never enter the guest.
- **Minimal filesystem**: the guest sees the baked harness image — never
  the host filesystem.
- **Resource limits**: Modal per-sandbox memory/CPU caps
  (`SANDBOX_MEMORY_LIMIT_MB`, `SANDBOX_CPU_LIMIT`) and a bounded lifetime
  (`SANDBOX_TIMEOUT_SECS`, default 4h).
- **Sessions live in the guest**: the embedded runtime owns per-session
  state (`ctx.state`, history, the resume grace window) exactly as the
  self-hosted runtime does. The control channel's `tool/execute` is only
  the studio's one-shot trial runner; the host holds no session state.

### Warm sandbox pool

The server can pre-spawn a pool of "warm" Node harnesses (process running,
WebSocket dialed, no bundle loaded) so first-session cold starts skip the
slow `Modal sandbox create → dial` path. On acquire, the harness is
finalized for the requesting agent by registering the db/query handler and
sending `bundle/load`.

- **Enable**: set `SANDBOX_POOL_SIZE` to a positive integer (max 16).
  Disabled when unset.
- **Files**: `sandbox-pool.ts` (pool), `sandbox-vm.ts:spawnWarmHarness` /
  `modal-sandbox.ts:spawnModalWarm` (spawn), `configureSandbox` (per-agent
  finalization).
- **Security**: the pool spawns harnesses with the same Modal sandbox
  parameters as on-demand sandboxes. Bundle code and agent env vars are
  injected per-acquire — no agent secrets enter a warm sandbox.
- **Failure mode**: if the pool is empty or returns a dead harness,
  `createSandboxVm` falls back to a fresh spawn (the pre-pool path).

### Horizontal sandbox scaling (aai-server/sandbox-scale.ts)

Opt-in: set `SANDBOX_MAX_SESSIONS` (live sessions per guest sandbox) to
enable; `SANDBOX_MAX_REPLICAS` caps sandboxes per slug (default 4). Unset,
a slug has exactly one sandbox — the pre-scaling behavior.

The broker (`GET /:slug/client-config` → `resolveSandbox`) is the only
routing point: sessions connect directly to a sandbox tunnel, so once a
client holds a `sessionUrl` the host can never move that session. Each
broker request probes the slug's resident sandboxes with the same guest
`status` RPC idle eviction uses and routes **least-connections**; when the
least-loaded sandbox is at capacity it spawns an overflow replica
(`AgentSlot.replicas`, under the slug lock so concurrent saturated brokers
spawn one, not one each), and past the cap it routes to the least-loaded
anyway with a warning. Scale-in is idle eviction's job: overflow replicas
whose sessions ended are reclaimed individually on the idle probe even
while the primary stays busy, and `terminateSlot` (deploy/delete/secret/
epoch invalidation) tears down primary and replicas together.
Least-connections is deliberately implemented in-repo rather than via a
balancer library: off-the-shelf Node balancers are stateless pickers that
infer load from the calls they routed, which cannot be truthful here —
sessions start and end without passing through the host, so the
guest-reported count is the only honest signal.

Scaling is per-replica (each web-service replica scales its own slot);
counts are sampled, not reserved, so `maxSessionsPerSandbox` is a target,
not a hard limit — simultaneous brokered clients can land on the same
sandbox before either connects.

### Platform sandbox (aai-server)

Agent code runs in **per-agent Modal Sandboxes**. Key files:
`packages/aai-server/sandbox.ts`, `sandbox-vm.ts`, `modal-sandbox.ts`,
`aai-guest/harness.ts`, `rpc-transport.ts`.

**Isolation layers:**

- **Filesystem**: the baked harness image. No host filesystem access.
- **Network**: open egress (the container is the boundary); ctx.db proxies
  through host RPC so platform credentials stay host-side.
- **Memory/CPU**: Modal per-sandbox limits; separate container per sandbox.
- **Env vars**: agent env is delivered to the guest via the `bundle/load`
  RPC params, never as process environment variables. Platform secrets
  stay host-side.

**Credential separation:**

Each agent provides its own `ASSEMBLYAI_API_KEY` via `.env` (local dev) or
`aai secret put` (production). There is no central/platform-owned key.
`SandboxOptions` has separate `apiKey` (host-only, for S2S connections) and
`agentEnv` (forwarded to guest) fields. The key is extracted from the agent's
stored env at sandbox creation time and kept host-side only.

- **App database**: per-app Postgres role/schema credentials are
  platform-provisioned and held in Supabase Vault — never in the agent's
  env, so tenant code can't read them.
- **Agent secrets**: stored in Supabase Vault (`agent-env:<slug>`), not
  encrypted blobs — the old master-key envelope encryption
  (`KV_SCOPE_SECRET`) is gone.
- **Credential resolution reads the agent env only — never `process.env`.**
  The platform host process holds its own credentials under exactly the names a
  tenant descriptor could resolve (`AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` /
  `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` for Supabase storage), so a fallback would let an
  agent that supplied no credential of its own silently borrow the
  platform's.

  There are **two** such helpers and both must stay sealed — closing only one
  leaves the leak open, since between them they cover every provider:
  - `resolveApiKey` (`providers/resolve.ts`) — descriptor-declared env keys.
  - `requireApiKey` (`providers/_utils.ts`) — every STT/TTS opener and every
    LLM (via `resolve.ts`'s `requireKey`).

  Self-hosted runs opt into shell-exported keys via
  `withHostCredentialFallback` (`providers/host-env.ts`), which copies only
  `PROVIDER_CREDENTIAL_ENVS` (derived from the provider registries). It feeds
  `RuntimeOptions.providerEnv`, **not** `env` — credentials must not land in
  `ctx.env`, both so agent code can't read them and so dev keeps parity with
  production in what `ctx.env` contains.

  The providerEnv-not-env rule is **type-enforced** via the branded env
  records in `sdk/env-types.ts`: `withHostCredentialFallback` is the only
  minter of `HostCredentialEnv`, which satisfies
  `RuntimeOptions.providerEnv` (`ProviderEnv`) but is a compile error for
  `RuntimeOptions.env` (`AgentEnv`) and everything else that becomes
  `ctx.env`. Plain records stay assignable to both, so only the dangerous
  flow needs ceremony; `env-types.test-d.ts` locks the assignability matrix.
  The brand is advisory against *deliberate* re-annotation — the point is
  that leaking host credentials into `ctx.env` can no longer be silent.

**Cross-agent isolation:**

- App databases are separate Postgres schemas with per-app login roles —
  agents cannot access each other's data.
- Each sandbox communicates over its own authenticated WebSocket.
- Sessions are per-sandbox (`Map<string, Session>`).
- No shared mutable state between sandboxes.

**`run_code` built-in tool (`aai-guest/trial.ts`):**

- Executes **only inside the guest sandbox** (Modal/Node): the harness wires
  its in-sandbox executor into the runtime as `RuntimeOptions.runCode`
  (`run_code` is in `SANDBOX_ONLY_BUILTINS`). The old host-side `node:vm`
  execution was removed — `node:vm` is not a security boundary; the Modal
  container is.
- The host-side `execute` (`builtin-run-code.ts`) is a guard for the
  self-hosted path (`aai dev`), which has no sandbox — it refuses rather
  than evaluating attacker-influenceable code in the host process.
- The executor is a bare `new Function` async wrapper: code runs with the
  **same authority as the rest of the sandboxed agent** — open egress,
  filesystem, env, child processes — and nothing more. There is deliberately
  no in-process capability stripping; the container is the whole boundary.
  (This is why the tool description promises only "output from console.log",
  not "no network/filesystem" — that claim would be false now.)
- 5-second execution timeout (enforced in the guest).

**SSRF protection (aai/host/ssrf.ts):**

- Lives in the SDK, not `aai-server`, so both the platform's guest-fetch proxy
  and the SDK's own network builtins resolve one implementation.
- `resolveAndAssertPublic()` uses the `bogon` library for private IP ranges.
- Handles IPv4-mapped IPv6 bypass (`::ffff:127.0.0.1`).
- Blocks `.internal`, `.local`, cloud metadata hostnames, and non-HTTP(S)
  protocols.
- Re-validates every redirect hop and strips credential headers once a redirect
  leaves the original origin.
- Pins the validated IP with an undici dispatcher `lookup` rather than
  rewriting the URL hostname. Rewriting broke TLS — SNI and cert verification
  use the URL, not the `Host` header — so every `https://` request failed. Keep
  the URL intact when touching this.
- **The dispatcher and the `fetch` it is handed to must come from the same
  undici.** `pinnedDispatcher` builds an `Agent` from this package's `undici`
  dependency, while `globalThis.fetch` is backed by the copy bundled into the
  Node runtime (`process.versions.undici`) — a different major. undici 8
  reworked the dispatch-handler interface, so a v8 `Agent` rejects the v7-style
  handler Node's internal fetch builds, with `InvalidArgumentError: invalid
  onRequestStart method` surfacing as a bare `TypeError: fetch failed`. A
  dispatcher is attached to *every* hostname request, so the mismatch takes out
  all SSRF-guarded egress at once — `web_search`, `visit_webpage`,
  `get_page_design`, and `fetch_json`. `safeFetch` therefore routes through
  `pinnedFetch`, undici's own `fetch`; never reintroduce `globalThis.fetch`
  there. Guarded by `ssrf-dispatcher.test.ts` — the rest of the SSRF suite
  injects a fake fetch and never builds a real dispatcher, which is why this
  shipped unnoticed. Two rules survived the (since-removed) tool-egress
  guard that first hit this: **the caller may not name a fetch
  implementation** (leave `fetchFn` unset — it exists for tests — so the
  pinned default applies), and the guard test has to cover the *call site*,
  not just `pinnedFetch` in isolation.

  **The request *body* crosses the same seam, and `FormData` does not survive
  it.** undici 8's `extractBody` brand-checks each body type with an
  `instanceof` against **its own** class, so a `globalThis.FormData` (an
  instance of Node's *internal* undici's class) matches no branch, falls
  through to the string conversion, and goes out as `Content-Type: text/plain`
  with the 17-byte body `[object FormData]` — the server answers
  `415 Unsupported Media Type` and the caller sees an opaque HTTP failure.

  The rule that generalizes: **never hand a `FormData`, `Blob`, `File`,
  `Headers`, or `Request` to a `fetch` that might not be the one your realm's
  global came from** — pass bytes.
- The network builtins (`web_search`, `visit_webpage`, `get_page_design`,
  `fetch_json`) take a
  model-controlled URL and **default** to this via `safeFetch` in
  `builtin-tools.ts`. Protection is not opt-in per caller; only tests override
  the `fetch` option.

**Auth:**

- API key ownership hashes are argon2id PHC strings (`secrets.ts`), verified
  constant-time inside `@node-rs/argon2` and cached by SHA-256(apiKey) —
  slug ownership is verified against stored credential hashes. There are no
  legacy hash/decrypt fallbacks (nothing predating the current scheme was
  ever deployed).
- Stored credentials (agent env vars / secrets) live in Supabase Vault,
  which encrypts at rest — there is deliberately no app-layer encryption
  on top.
- Deploys go through the single `POST /deploy` route (slug in the body);
  the legacy `POST /:slug/deploy` route was removed.
- Deploys check slug ownership whether the slug was requested or generated —
  a `humanId()` collision returns 409 rather than overwriting an existing
  agent and appending the caller's credential hash to it.

### Host mode on deployed agents (`aai-server/ws-host-mode.ts`)

A deployed agent's `WS /:slug/websocket` accepts `?host=1`, the same override
channel the dev server offers: the caller supplies `systemPrompt`, `greeting`,
and relayed tool schemas, and the session runs on the *deployed agent's*
credentials and provider pipeline.

The gate differs from the dev server's on purpose. `aai dev` is single-user
and loopback-bound, so `AAI_ALLOW_HOST` is an adequate control. The platform
is multi-tenant and an agent's WebSocket is deliberately **unauthenticated** —
anyone with the URL can talk to it. Allowing prompt/tool overrides on that
footing would make every deployed agent an open LLM proxy billed to its owner.
So `?host=1` requires `Authorization: Bearer <api key>` on the upgrade,
verified against slug ownership (the check `/:slug/secret` and `/:slug/storage`
already use). `startHostSession` gained an `allowHost` option so the platform
can gate on ownership instead of the env flag, which would be all-or-nothing
across tenants.

Details worth keeping:

- **Header, not a query param.** A URL leaks through proxy logs, history, and
  `Referer`, and this token is the caller's whole platform credential.
  Browsers can't set WebSocket headers, which is intended — host mode is for
  programmatic clients.
- **A refusal answers the handshake** (401/403 + reason) rather than dropping
  the socket; a bare RST is indistinguishable from a network fault.
- **Unknown slug and forbidden slug return the same thing**, so a non-owner
  gets no existence oracle.
- **Runs in the server process, not the guest sandbox.** Host mode replaces
  the agent's tools with ones relayed to the caller, so there is no tenant
  code to isolate. It builds its base agent with the same `toRuntimeAgent`
  the sandbox path uses, which keeps the provider descriptors on the agent
  object — otherwise a pipeline agent would silently fall back to S2S when
  driven over `?host=1`.
- Plain connections are untouched and stay unauthenticated.

### Self-hosted server defaults (`aai/host/server.ts`)

`createServer` has no request authentication of its own — it is the `aai dev`
backend, not the managed platform. Two defaults exist because of that, and
both are fail-closed:

- **Binds loopback.** `listen(port, host = DEFAULT_LISTEN_HOST)` defaults to
  `127.0.0.1`. Pass `"0.0.0.0"` deliberately to expose it; binding every
  interface by default put a developer's agent (and the provider credentials
  behind it) in reach of anyone on the same network. `aai dev` exposes this as
  `AAI_DEV_HOST` for setups where loopback isn't reachable (e.g. running in a
  container and connecting from the host).
- **Host mode is opt-in.** A `?host=1` WebSocket lets the *client* supply the
  agent definition (`systemPrompt`, `greeting`, relayed tool schemas) while the
  session runs on the operator's credentials, so `isHostAllowed` requires an
  explicit `AAI_ALLOW_HOST` of `1`/`true`/`yes`/`on`. Unset means off.
  Harnesses (e.g. tau2) set it themselves. Note `resolveServerEnv` only
  surfaces keys declared in `.env`, so `aai dev` passes the shell value through
  explicitly (`hostModeEnv`) — otherwise exporting the variable the usual way
  would have no effect.

### CLI credential destinations (`aai-cli/_agent.ts`)

`.aai/project.json` is in the working tree, so a cloned repo controls its
`serverUrl` — and `aai deploy` / `aai secret` pair that URL with the user's API
key and secret values. `resolveServerUrl` therefore honors a config-supplied
origin only when it is the shipped default or already in `approvedServers` in
the user-owned global config. Loopback origins are deliberately NOT implicitly
trusted from config — a repo-supplied `http://localhost:<port>` would hand the
key to whatever is listening on that local port (dev mode targets its own
default server before the project config is consulted, so `aai dev` workflows
are unaffected). Passing `--server` is what approves an origin (it is user
intent, not repo content) and is remembered for later commands. Never widen
this to trust `serverUrl` directly.

The `slug` from the same file is validated against the platform's slug shape
(`VALID_SLUG_RE`, shared with aai-server via `@alexkroman1/aai/utils` —
`sdk/slug.ts` is the single definition) before it is ever
interpolated into a URL path, so a hostile `"slug": "x/../admin"` cannot steer
a credentialed request; `aai secret delete` also URL-encodes the secret name.
The API key itself is stored 0600 in the global `config.json`
(`AAI_CONFIG_DIR` overrides the config dir location), and `ensureApiKey`
refuses to prompt without a TTY — the hidden prompt would otherwise consume
piped stdin as keystrokes.

Note also that `aai build` and `aai dev` evaluate the repository's bundled
`agent.ts` in the host process (`evalWorkerBundle`, via a `data:` URL
import) — running either against an untrusted clone executes that repo's
code locally. `aai deploy` no longer does: every worker self-describes its
config (`__aaiConfig`, generated by `buildWorker`'s wrapper entry) and the
server extracts it guest-side (`extractAgentConfig` → `describeBundle`), so
the deploy path uploads without evaluating. A bare `aai` in a project still
asks for confirmation on a TTY before implicitly deploying.

### Testing security boundaries

- `modal-sandbox.test.ts` — Modal spawn flow against an injected fake
  context: sandbox creation, tunnel dial + per-sandbox token, teardown on
  failure. (Isolation itself — filesystem, memory — is enforced by Modal's
  sandbox boundary, not host code.)
- `aai-guest/harness.test.ts` — the guest's `run_code`
  executor (console capture, thrown-error reporting, timeout). It does NOT
  test network/filesystem/env denial: the executor has no in-process
  sandbox — the Modal container is the boundary, so those are Modal's to
  enforce, not host code's.
- `net.test.ts` / `ssrf-extended.test.ts` — SSRF bypass prevention
  (IPv4-mapped IPv6, cloud metadata, `.internal` domains).

There is deliberately **no load or chaos tier.** `packages/aai-server/load/`
and `packages/aai-server/adversarial/` (plus the `load-and-adversarial` CI
job and `docker-compose.load.yml`) were deleted, because what they asserted
had drifted away from what they claimed to test:

- The two "adversarial" tests deployed an agent whose tool body was a
  `while (true) {}` spin or an unbounded allocation loop — **and then never
  invoked it.** No message was ever sent on the socket and the deploy seeded
  a fake `ASSEMBLYAI_API_KEY`, so no LLM existed to call the tool. Both
  amounted to "an idle server stays under 90% memory." Their docstrings still
  described "the isolate" and a "V8 heap (128 MB limit)" — the secure-exec
  design replaced two architectures ago.
- `lru-eviction.test.ts` configured `MAX_SLOTS` / `SLOT_IDLE_MS`, neither of
  which exists in the server anymore; testcontainers passes unknown env vars
  through silently, so it stayed green while testing nothing.
- `ws-memory.test.ts`, `session-memory.test.ts`, and
  `s2s-session-memory.test.ts` were benchmarks with `.test.ts` extensions —
  their only assertions were shape checks like `results.length > 0` and
  `sessions.length === TIERS.at(-1)`. `ws-memory` imported no aai-server code
  at all; it measured the `ws` package.
- `sandbox-storm.test.ts` swallowed deploy failures and passed on
  `aliveCount > 0` — 1 of 14 sandboxes working was a pass.

Two were real (`connection-flood`, `kv-corruption`), but not worth an 8-minute
Docker job wired into the required `ci` gate, where a wall-clock memory
threshold on a shared runner blocks merges when it flakes.

If you reintroduce load or chaos testing, the bar is: **the hostile code must
actually execute** (put it at the bundle's top level so `bundle/load` triggers
it — no LLM needed), the thresholds must be tied to constants the server
really reads, and it belongs outside the merge gate. Note also that a
successful WebSocket upgrade proves nothing about the sandbox:
a client can hold an open `/session` socket to a guest whose runtime
failed to build (it is accepted, then closed 1011), so `opened.length === 1`
can hold while every sandbox fails.

### Known limitations

- **Type-level tests**: Cover public entry points of `aai` (`.`, `./types`)
  and `aai-ui` (`.`). Subpath exports (e.g. `./protocol`) are not covered
  by type tests.
