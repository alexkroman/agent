# packages/aai — SDK guide

The shared core SDK (`@alexkroman1/aai`). Repo-wide commands, conventions,
testing rules, and the changeset/PR workflow live in the root `CLAUDE.md`;
platform behaviour lives in `packages/aai-server/CLAUDE.md`.

## SDK structure

The SDK is organized into two directories with a **hard dependency
boundary** — this split is critical for sandbox security:

- **`sdk/`** — shared modules with **zero Node.js dependencies**. Safe to
  run in browsers, Deno, and sandboxed environments. Contains:
  `types.ts`, `db.ts`, `hooks.ts`, `utils.ts`, `constants.ts`,
  `protocol.ts`, `system-prompt.ts`,
  `ws-upgrade.ts`, `_internal-types.ts`, `agent-config.ts` (the canonical
  serializable config + `toAgentConfig`), `schema.ts` (Standard Schema
  acceptance: `inputSchema` validation + JSON Schema conversion),
  `define.ts` (`agent()` and `tool()` helpers for authoring `agent.ts`
  files).
- **`host/`** — host-only modules that **require Node.js APIs** (`node:vm`,
  `node:crypto`, etc.). Only runs on the platform server and CLI, never
  inside a guest sandbox. Contains:
  `server.ts`, `runtime.ts`, `runtime-config.ts`, `runtime-types.ts`,
  `runtime-transport.ts` (transport selection/construction for the runtime),
  `tool-executor.ts`, `session-core.ts`, `s2s.ts`, `ws-handler.ts`,
  `transports/` (S2S / pipeline / OpenAI Realtime `Transport`
  implementations, including `pipeline-turn-outcome.ts` — the three ways a
  pipeline turn ends: interrupted by barge-in, failed, or spoken), `to-vercel-tools.ts`,
  `providers/` (STT/TTS openers + descriptor→instance resolvers),
  `builtin-tools.ts`, `postgres-db.ts`.

**Rule**: When adding new SDK code, place it in `sdk/` if it has no
`node:` dependencies. Moving code from `sdk/` → `host/` is safe;
moving `host/` → `sdk/` requires removing all Node.js imports first.

The guest harness (`packages/aai-guest/harness.ts`) runs **Node** inside each Modal
Sandbox — the same runtime as the host and `aai dev` — loading the agent's
ESM bundle directly; the Modal sandbox (not a language runtime permission
model) is the security boundary.

## Package exports

Subpath exports consumed by sibling packages and user agents:

- `.` — `agent()`, `tool()` helpers, `Db`, types, utils, constants
- `./utils` — zod-free utilities + platform slug contract (fast CLI startup path)
- `./runtime` — full Node.js runtime engine (barrel → 11 host/ modules)
- `./protocol` — wire-format Zod schemas, `lenientParse()`, `ClientEvent`
- `./manifest` — `toAgentConfig()`, `agentToolsToSchemas()`, config schemas
- `./stt` — pipeline-mode STT provider factories (e.g. `assemblyAIStt`)
- `./llm` — pipeline-mode LLM provider factories (e.g. `anthropic`)
- `./tts` — pipeline-mode TTS provider factories (e.g. `cartesia`)
- `./s2s` — S2S provider factories (`openaiRealtime`)
- `./tools` — keyless network builtins callable from user tool code
- `./internal` — infrastructure shared with sibling packages (epochs,
  owned maps, WS upgrade parsing, schema-issue formatting); not a public
  API, kept off the root barrel so authoring autocomplete stays small.
  The env brands live on `./runtime` instead — they appear in its public
  signatures (`RuntimeOptions`, `withHostCredentialFallback`)

## Subpath export → file mapping

Tracing imports through barrel files can be confusing. Here's the map
of subpath exports in `aai/package.json`:

| Import path | Resolves to | What it contains |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `@alexkroman1/aai` | `packages/aai/index.ts` → 6 modules | Types, Db, utils, constants, `agent()`/`tool()` helpers |
| `@alexkroman1/aai/utils` | `sdk/utils.ts` (direct, not a barrel) | Zod-free utilities (`errorMessage`, `errorDetail`, …) + the slug contract (`VALID_SLUG_RE`, `RESERVED_SLUGS` from `sdk/slug.ts`). Deliberately dependency-free so the CLI can load it on every invocation without paying zod's startup cost |
| `@alexkroman1/aai/runtime` | `host/runtime-barrel.ts` → 11 modules | Full Node.js runtime: session, S2S, server, tools, WS handler |
| `@alexkroman1/aai/protocol` | `sdk/protocol.ts` (direct, not a barrel) | Wire-format Zod schemas, `lenientParse()`, `ClientEvent`, `ServerMessage` |
| `@alexkroman1/aai/manifest` | `sdk/manifest-barrel.ts` → 3 modules | `toAgentConfig()`, `agentToolsToSchemas()`, `AgentConfig`/`ToolSchema` + their Zod schemas, config-rule asserts. (The subpath name is historical — the old `parseManifest()`/`Manifest` layer was deleted; renaming the published subpath wasn't worth the break.) |
| `@alexkroman1/aai/stt` | `sdk/providers/stt-barrel.ts` | STT provider factories + types (`assemblyAIStt`, `deepgram`, `elevenlabs`, `soniox`) |
| `@alexkroman1/aai/llm` | `sdk/providers/llm-barrel.ts` | LLM provider factories + types (`anthropic`, `openai`, `google`, `mistral`, `xai`, `groq`, `openrouter`, `gateway`) |
| `@alexkroman1/aai/tts` | `sdk/providers/tts-barrel.ts` | TTS provider factories + types (`cartesia`, `rime`, `assemblyAITts`) |
| `@alexkroman1/aai/s2s` | `sdk/providers/s2s-barrel.ts` | S2S provider factories + types (`openaiRealtime`; `assemblyAIS2s` is on the root export) |
| `@alexkroman1/aai/tools` | `host/agent-tools.ts` (direct, not a barrel) | Keyless network builtins callable from user tool code: `fetchJson`, `visitWebpage`, `webSearch` |
| `@alexkroman1/aai/internal` | `internal.ts` → 5 modules | Cross-package infrastructure (`createEpoch`, `createOwnedMap`, `createCoalescingRunner`, `parseWsUpgradeParams`, `formatSchemaIssues`). Not public API, not semver-covered, excluded from the docs |

## Session modes

Each agent runs in one of two session modes, selected by `toAgentConfig()`
(run in the generated bundle entry) based on which top-level fields are
present in the `agent()` config:

- **Pipeline mode** (the DEFAULT — all three of `stt`, `llm`, and `tts`
  set, or none of the four provider fields set, in which case the
  all-AssemblyAI pipeline (`assemblyAIPipeline()`) is injected by
  `defaultProviders` in `sdk/providers/_default-providers.ts`) uses
  `createPipelineTransport()` in
  `packages/aai/host/transports/pipeline-transport.ts`. Here the host
  drives the LLM loop itself via the Vercel AI SDK's `streamText`, and STT
  and TTS are pluggable providers imported from the `@alexkroman1/aai/stt`
  and `@alexkroman1/aai/tts` subpath exports.

  **A failing TURN is not a failing SESSION** (`EmitError` in
  `transports/types.ts`, `createEmitError` in `transports/pipeline-error.ts`).
  `onError` defaults to `fatal: true`, and aai-ui answers a fatal frame by
  calling `cleanupAudio()`, bumping the connection generation and setting
  `running: false` — the microphone is RELEASED and the call ends. Only the two
  paths that really terminate may report that way, and both call `terminate()`:
  `onProviderError` and the provider-open rejection (a session with no STT
  cannot hear). The three turn-level reporters pass `{ fatal: false }` — an
  `error` part in the LLM stream, a thrown `streamText`, and a TTS flush
  timeout. Reported as fatal, the first two were especially perverse: the
  transport's next act is to speak `errorPhrase` ("Sorry, I had a problem just
  then. Could you say that again?") and invite another turn, so the caller was
  asked to repeat themselves into a microphone the client had just switched off,
  while the TTS case ended a live call over one clipped sentence. The pipeline
  fuzz covers both LLM reporters (separate code paths: an `error` stream part,
  and a request that never streams); the TTS one needs a real deadline to
  elapse, so a deterministic spec pins it.
- **S2S mode** (explicit opt-in — `s2s: assemblyAIS2s()` from the main
  export, or `openaiRealtime()` from `@alexkroman1/aai/s2s`) uses
  `createS2sTransport()` in `packages/aai/host/transports/s2s-transport.ts`.
  The host opens a single WebSocket to AssemblyAI's speech-to-speech
  service; STT, the LLM loop, and TTS all run service-side and audio/events
  relay through that one socket. This is the original architecture, and was
  the implicit default before the pipeline-by-default flip. There is no way
  to reach S2S by omission — only the `s2s` descriptor selects it.

  **S2S has no agent captions on tool-call turns, and this is not our bug.**
  Measured against the live service (2026-08-03) with a standalone WebSocket
  client, no SDK in the path: `transcript.agent` is emitted for every non-tool
  reply with a matching `reply_id`, and for NEITHER reply of a tool-call turn —
  not the one carrying `tool.call`, not the one after `tool.result`. Declaring
  tools changes nothing; calling one does. So a tool-using agent renders blank
  reply text for exactly the turns that do the work, `reply.done` logs
  `agentText: "none"`, and `replyAnomaly` warns "delivered audio with no
  transcript" once per tool turn. There is no client-side remedy —
  `transcript.agent` is the only event in the protocol carrying agent text.
  Anything reading reply text (history, evals, a tau2-style harness scoring
  what the agent *said*) sees silence for a turn the user heard answered.

  Two traps here. The docs contradict each other on whether it is intended:
  the canonical message-sequence page shows `transcript.agent` inside its
  `opt tool call` branch and calls it "Per agent reply", while the
  execution-modes page's `interactive` diagram shows neither tool-turn reply
  emitting it — the service matches the latter. And
  `transcript.agent.delta` is documented in the events reference but **is not
  implemented**: zero frames arrive even for a plain greeting reply that does
  send `transcript.agent`, and it appears nowhere on the canonical page. An
  accumulator for it was added (#a42cdbd3) and removed again once measurement
  showed it could never fire; do not re-add one on the strength of the docs.

  **An in-band service error is NOT the end of the session, and a fatal frame
  is not a banner.** `SessionCore.onError` defaults to `fatal: true`, and
  aai-ui answers a fatal frame by calling `cleanupAudio()`, bumping the
  connection generation, and setting `running: false` — the MICROPHONE IS
  RELEASED. Both S2S transports used to report every in-band error that way:
  AssemblyAI's `session.error` with a non-expiry code (a rate limit, a rejected
  field) and its bare `error` frame, OpenAI Realtime's `error` event. None of
  those closes the socket, so the conversation demonstrably continued —
  `tool_call`, `reply_done`, and audio all arrived afterwards on most fuzz
  seeds — to a client that could no longer hear anyone, and a later event even
  recovered its state to "listening" (`clearRecoveredError`), leaving a session
  that looks live and is deaf. They now pass `{ fatal: false }`; the *only*
  reporter of session death is the close/failed-resume path (`endSession`),
  which is the one place that knows the link is gone and attaches the close
  code. A truly terminal error is still covered, because the service closes the
  socket after it. Note session-core logs a non-fatal error at DEBUG, so
  `s2s.ts` logs the `error` frame's message itself at warn — demoting the
  client-facing severity must not also make the service's complaint invisible.

  **Retiring the session must also DROP THE LINK** (`endSession`). Most fatal
  paths arrive from a close, where the socket is already gone — but not all:
  when the service rejects a `session.resume` with `session_not_found` it says
  so IN BAND and leaves the socket OPEN. The transport went on holding a live
  (billed) provider session and relaying its frames to a client it had just
  told the call was over. `endSession` closes the socket, drops the handle and
  the queued tool results, and the inbound callbacks are gated on the session
  still being live (`whileLive`) — `close()` does not un-deliver what is already
  buffered.

  **`stop()` must be able to abandon a handshake that has not completed**
  (`ConnectS2sOptions.signal`, aborted by the transport's `teardown` controller).
  `handle?.close()` can only reach a socket that OPENED: `connectS2s` returns a
  handle only on `open`, and `ws` sets no `handshakeTimeout`, so a client that
  hangs up mid-resume left a half-open (billed) provider connection pinned for
  the life of the process — nothing anywhere held a reference to close. A connect
  that loses this race is swallowed rather than reported: we aborted it, and
  there is no session left to fail. All three of these came out of the S2S
  property test (see "S2S property test" below), which shrank the last one
  to two commands: `session.ready`, then a transient drop.

The default injection runs at every mode-derivation site — `toAgentConfig`
(so it is baked into deployed configs at build time) and `createRuntime`'s
provider resolution — before `assertProviderTriple`.
Partial provider configs are FILLED, not rejected: `defaultProviders`
supplies the AssemblyAI default for each unset stage of `stt`/`llm`/`tts`
(when `s2s` is unset), so `agent({ llm: anthropic(...) })` means "the
default pipeline with that LLM". The compile-time union (`AgentParams` in
`sdk/define.ts`) matches: any subset of the triple is legal, while `s2s`
combined with a pipeline provider or a pipeline-only tuning field still
fails `tsc` with a message naming the rule (`PipelineOnlyMisuse`) instead
of silently no-opping. `assertProviderTriple`'s partial-triple error now
only guards raw wire shapes that skipped the fill.

- **Tool-call args must be coerced before they hit a wire schema.** The AI
  SDK surfaces an unparsable/unknown tool call as a `tool-call` stream part
  whose `input` is the *raw argument string*, not a parsed object. The
  WebSocket `tool_call` event requires a record for `args`, so every emitter
  routes args through `toArgsRecord` (`sdk/utils.ts`; non-records become
  `{}`), and a failed/invalid call is recorded with an error `result` rather
  than left dangling.

- **The capture worklet** (`worklets/capture-processor.ts`) is the single
  mic-capture processor. It flushes a `slice()` copy and keeps its own
  buffer (re-reading a just-transferred view is how a mic once went
  permanently deaf), with start/stop gating, a stop → flush → `stopped`-ack
  protocol, and the dead-mic probe. Two guards remain load-bearing:
  `instantiateWorklet`'s harness honors the transfer list (`structuredClone`
  with `transfer`, which really detaches) and caps posted messages so a
  runaway loop is a named failure rather than a hang, and
  `worklets/capture-processor.test.ts` exercises the processor source.

- **Pre-connection client config**: the default client page is
  byte-identical for every agent and the CSP bars inline scripts, so the
  agent's display name and greeting reach the browser via a pre-connection
  endpoint: `GET /client-config` (dev server) / `GET /:slug/client-config`
  (platform, unauthenticated — parity with the page and the WebSocket)
  returns `{ name, greeting }` (`sdk/client-config.ts`, re-exported from
  `/protocol`). **Every server builds the body through one helper**,
  `buildClientConfig`; the platform's handler lives in
  `aai-server/client-config-handler.ts` — and on the platform name/greeting
  are PROXIED from the GUEST'S own `/client-config` (the bundle's live
  agent definition; the harness passes the loaded agent's name/greeting to
  `createServer`), never read from the stored config, which is fully opaque
  to the host. A guest that can't answer degrades to `{ sessionUrl }` only.
  In `aai-ui`, `client()`'s config
  tier renders `DefaultRoot`, which fetches the config (any failure degrades
  to the empty default, so older servers keep working) and mounts the chat
  shell; the shell uses the server-declared `name` unless `client({ name })`
  overrides it. A custom `component` ignores all of it. The `aai dev` Vite
  proxy forwards `/client-config` to the backend.

  **The session's per-attempt broker lookup uses `loadClientConfig`, not
  `fetchClientConfig`** — it returns `null` for a lookup that produced no
  answer, keeping that distinct from a server that answered and named no
  `sessionUrl`. Degrading both to `{}` is fine for name/greeting and wrong
  here: `session-core.ts` latches `serverIsBroker = false` on a config with
  no `sessionUrl`, and that latch skips the broker fetch on every later
  attempt. So one 503 — a sandbox mid-boot, or one that failed to start —
  pinned the client to the platform's `/:slug/websocket`, whose WebSocket
  redirect browsers do not follow (sessions go straight to the sandbox now),
  with no route back even after the agent recovered. Only an ANSWERED lookup
  may set the latch.

- **There is no text-only mode.** Every pipeline agent declares a real TTS
  provider, and the default `ChatView` always renders the voice `Controls`.
  The snapshot's `apiUrl` field carries the programmatic WebSocket endpoint,
  shown by `ApiUrlChip`. **It is the LONG-LIVING platform endpoint**
  (`wss://host/:slug/websocket`), never the brokered sandbox tunnel URL the
  session actually connects to — the tunnel URL dies with the sandbox (idle
  eviction, redeploy), so surfacing it hands users a link that rots. The
  platform endpoint stays valid: a plain upgrade on it resolves the live
  sandbox (booting it like the client-config broker) and answers a 302
  redirect to the sandbox's current session URL (`orchestrator-ws.ts`,
  query preserved so `?sessionId=` resumes survive). Programmatic WebSocket
  clients that follow handshake redirects land on the sandbox; browsers
  don't follow WebSocket redirects, which is fine — the browser path is the
  client-config broker.

Reference providers shipped today:

- **STT**: one of
  - `assemblyAIStt({ model: "universal-3-5-pro" })` — `ASSEMBLYAI_API_KEY`
  - `deepgram({ model: "nova-3" })` — `DEEPGRAM_API_KEY`
  - `elevenlabs({ model: "scribe_v2_realtime" })` — `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY`
  - `soniox({ model: "stt-rt-v3" })` — `SONIOX_API_KEY`

  **Never inherit the `assemblyai` SDK's connect deadline.** Its default
  `connectTimeout` is **1000 ms** and covers far more than a socket open: the
  timer is armed before the WebSocket is constructed and only cleared when the
  server's `Begin` message arrives, so DNS + TCP + TLS + upgrade + the
  service's session-start latency all have to fit. A link measuring ~50 ms to
  TLS still blew it — a slow `Begin`, or a host event loop briefly blocked
  (this is a wall-clock `setTimeout`, not an I/O deadline), is enough. All
  three attempts then failed identically and the session died on a fatal
  `stt_connect_failed`, which reads as a provider outage and is not one.
  `host/providers/stt/assemblyai.ts` therefore always sets
  `connectTimeout`/`maxConnectionRetries`/`connectionRetryDelay` from
  `STT_CONNECT_*` in `sdk/constants.ts`, overridable per agent via
  `assemblyAIStt({ connectTimeoutMs, maxConnectRetries })`. The retry policy is
  pinned rather than left to the SDK so the worst-case open time is arithmetic
  we own: it runs inside `session.start()`, so a budget exceeding
  `DEFAULT_SESSION_START_TIMEOUT_MS` could only surface as the less specific
  "session.start() timed out". `assemblyai.test.ts` asserts that sum.

  **`assemblyAIStt({ streamingUrl })` overrides the streaming endpoint** — for
  a staging cluster, or to A/B a pre-release host against the default. It is
  the same `websocketBaseUrl` mechanism `region: "eu"` already used, so an
  explicit URL WINS over `region`: naming an endpoint is deliberate and the
  residency shorthand must not silently overwrite it. The URL must carry the
  versioned path (`wss://host/v3/ws`); the SDK supplies that only for its own
  default host, so a bare origin connects to the wrong route and fails at
  connect. Leave unset in production — the SDK's default already tracks path
  bumps, which is why the US case pins nothing host-side.

  **An unset `languages` is "detect per turn", NOT "English".** Universal-3.5
  Pro code-switches across 18 languages natively, so a monolingual line pays
  for detection it does not want — and the failure does not look like a
  language problem. Measured against tau2-bench retail, English utterances came
  back transliterated into Devanagari and Hebrew script (`Hello? Any update?` →
  `हेलो एनी अपडेट`), authentication turns included, so the tool arguments built
  from them were garbage while every transcript looked like an ordinary
  mis-hearing. `assemblyAIStt({ languages: ["en"] })` pins one language (the
  `language_codes` connection parameter); a multi-element list biases toward a
  known subset while keeping code-switching. It stays UNSENT when absent — a
  host-side default would silently disable multilingual transcription for every
  agent, which is the mirror-image bug.
- **LLM**: one of the typed factories below — each returns a pure
  descriptor; the `@ai-sdk/*` package is only imported by the host-side
  resolver (`host/providers/resolve.ts`), never by the agent bundle:
  - `anthropic({ model })` — `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
  - `openai({ model })` — `OPENAI_API_KEY`
  - `google({ model })` — `GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY`
  - `mistral({ model })` — `MISTRAL_API_KEY`
  - `xai({ model })` — `XAI_API_KEY`
  - `groq({ model })` — `GROQ_API_KEY`
  - `openrouter({ model })` — `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`; routes through
    [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai)'s OpenAI-compatible
    chat-completions endpoint, one key fronting hundreds of models
    addressed as `"creator/model"` (e.g.
    `openrouter({ model: "meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct" })`).
    Resolved via `@ai-sdk/openai`'s `.chat()` client pointed at the
    OpenRouter base URL — no extra `@ai-sdk/*` dependency.
  - `gateway({ model })` — `AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY`; routes through the
    [Vercel AI Gateway](https://vercel.com/docs/ai-gateway), one endpoint
    fronting hundreds of models addressed as `"creator/model"` (e.g.
    `gateway({ model: "zai/glm-4.6" })`). Resolved via `createGateway`
    from the `ai` package — no extra `@ai-sdk/*` dependency.
  - `assemblyAILlm({ model, region? })` — `ASSEMBLYAI_API_KEY`; routes through
    the [AssemblyAI LLM Gateway](https://www.assemblyai.com/docs/llm-gateway)
    (OpenAI-compatible chat-completions endpoint fronting 25+ models) via
    `@ai-sdk/openai`'s `.chat()` client. `region: "eu"` selects the EU
    The client is built with a `fetch` wrapper,
    `repairOpenAiStream` (`host/providers/_openai-stream-repair.ts`): the
    gateway documents streamed responses for OpenAI models only, and its
    Claude streams break two AI SDK expectations. (1) `tool_calls` deltas
    arrive with no `id`/`type`, which makes `StreamingToolCallTracker` in
    `@ai-sdk/provider-utils` throw `Expected 'id' to be a string` and kill any
    turn that calls a tool — the wrapper fills in a synthetic id (stable per
    tool-call index within one response) and `type: "function"`, leaving real
    ids alone. (2) The final usage-only chunk carries `"choices": null` where
    the schema requires an array, so the turn dies with "Type validation
    failed" *after* the reply has streamed — the wrapper rewrites that null to
    `[]` (an absent `choices` stays absent). Every other byte passes through.
    Remove each repair once the gateway emits conformant frames.
- **TTS**: one of
  - `cartesia({ voice })` — `CARTESIA_API_KEY`
  - `rime({ voice })` — `RIME_API_KEY`
  - `assemblyAITts({ voice, language? })` — `ASSEMBLYAI_API_KEY`; AssemblyAI's
    streaming TTS over `wss://streaming-tts.assemblyai.com/v1/ws/`.
    Sharing one key with STT and the gateway means an all-AssemblyAI pipeline
    needs exactly one secret. Two protocol details that are easy to get wrong:
    the streaming sockets authenticate with the **raw** key, not `Bearer`, and
    production sends no `Begin` frame until the client speaks first, so the
    adapter must not block waiting for one (the AssemblyAI CLI does, which is
    why it marks prod streaming TTS unavailable). Turns end on `FlushDone`;
    a rejected key arrives in-band as an `Error` frame, i.e. as
    `tts_stream_error` rather than `tts_auth_failed`.

    A third, and the one that decides whether the agent feels responsive:
    **`Generate` only buffers — `Flush` is what starts synthesis.** Unlike
    Cartesia (`continue: true` synthesizes on arrival), relaying LLM deltas and
    flushing once makes time-to-first-audio the length of the whole turn, since
    the pipeline's only provider-level flush is the end-of-turn drain
    (`flushTtsAndWait`, once per reply — after every LLM step *and* tool call).
    A tool-chaining reply was silent for its entire duration, `holdPhrase` and
    the dead-air cover included, as those are just more buffered text. The
    adapter therefore buffers host-side and emits `Generate`+`Flush` per
    *sentence*: measured, that is ~350ms to first audio instead of the full
    turn, for ~4% more total audio, where flushing every word-granularity delta
    costs 2.6x and sounds disjointed. Two invariants come with it — only the
    turn's **last** acknowledgement may emit `done` (`flushTtsAndWait` resolves
    on it, so a segment's `FlushDone` leaking through advances the orchestrator
    mid-reply), and the end-of-turn flush is never sent empty, so `done` never
    depends on the service acking a contentless `Flush`. See the module doc in
    `host/providers/tts/assemblyai.ts` for the measurements.

The provider SDKs (`ai`, `assemblyai`, `@cartesia/cartesia-js`,
`@ai-sdk/*`, …) are regular dependencies of `@alexkroman1/aai`, but they
are only imported by the host-side openers/resolvers in
`host/providers/` — the descriptor factories in `sdk/providers/` are pure
data, so agent bundles never pull provider SDKs into the guest sandbox.

Each provider defines its `KIND` tag and `<PROVIDER>_API_KEY_ENV`
constant once in its `sdk/providers/{stt,tts,llm}/<name>.ts` module.
Adding a provider means: descriptor factory there, an opener in
`host/providers/{stt,tts}/` (built on the shared session shell in
`host/providers/_utils.ts`), and one registry/switch entry in
`host/providers/resolve.ts`.

## Voices

**`ASSEMBLYAI_TTS_VOICES` in `sdk/providers/tts/assemblyai.ts` is the list.**
Read it there; do not restate it here, and do not trust a voice name that
isn't in it.

That instruction is the whole point of the constant. This section used to
carry its own table — `ivy`, `sam`, `mia`, `jack`, `sophie`, `oliver` and a
dozen more — of which every entry was either deprecated or had never
existed, and it claimed a `voice:` field on `agent()` that the SDK does not
have. The provider's doc comment carried a *different* wrong list
(`azelma`, `cosette`, `fantine`, `javert`, …, none published). Two
hand-maintained lists, both fiction, both pointed at by anyone looking for a
voice.

The failure they cause is invisible at authoring time: a wrong voice id is
rejected in-band after the TTS socket opens, so the agent connects, reports
ready, and is permanently silent. Nothing before a live session catches it.
Hence one checkable constant, with the accent alongside each name and the
deprecated set kept separately in `ASSEMBLYAI_TTS_DEPRECATED_VOICES`.

On the default pipeline the voice is the top-level `voice` field —
`agent({ voice: "michael" })`, an author convenience desugared to
`tts: assemblyAITts({ voice })` in `normalizeAgentConveniences` (typed
against the catalog, invalid alongside an explicit `tts` descriptor, which
owns its own voice). An explicit AssemblyAI TTS stage picks it with
`assemblyAITts({ voice })` from `@alexkroman1/aai/tts` (or
`assemblyAIPipeline({ voice })`). S2S mode's voice rides on the `s2s`
descriptor — `voice` is a compile error there.

## `ctx.generate` (one-shot LLM generation)

Tool `execute` code gets one-shot LLM generation via `ctx.generate` — a
**runtime capability like `ctx.db`**. One implementation,
`createGenerateFn` (`host/generate.ts`, exported from `/runtime`), runs
wherever the runtime runs — inside the guest sandbox on the platform,
in-process under `aai dev`: descriptors resolve through the same
`resolveLlm` registry as the pipeline model, credentials from the agent env
only. Defaults to the agent's own pipeline `llm`; a per-call `llm`
descriptor (or model-id string — same shorthand as `agent({ llm })`) works
for S2S agents holding that provider's key.

`GenerateOptions.schema` accepts a Zod schema directly (or any Standard
Schema convertible to JSON Schema — `sdk/schema.ts` owns detection and
conversion), converted before the provider call; a plain JSON Schema object
also works. `GenerateFn` is generic, so a Standard Schema call returns a
typed `object`. Note zod 4.4 stamps `~standard` onto its plain
`toJSONSchema()` OUTPUT too — schema detection keys off the `_zod` instance
marker, never the `~standard` interface (`isConvertibleSchema`).
(The pattern-combinator layer that once wrapped this —
`@alexkroman1/aai/patterns`, earlier `@alexkroman1/aai/workflow` — was
removed unused; multi-step orchestration is composed directly over
`ctx.generate`.)

## Storage (`ctx.db`)

There is no KV store anymore. Persistent state is the opt-in **app
database**: enabling storage for an app (CLI `aai storage enable <slug>`; the
studio's Settings pane → Database, which switches BOTH of a project's agents
at once — see the Database-card note in
`packages/aai-studio-client/CLAUDE.md`; or
`DATABASE_URL` in the project `.env` under
`aai dev`) gives its tools `ctx.db` — a SQL handle
(`query<T>(sql, params?)`, `$1` placeholders) backed by a per-app schema in
the platform's Supabase Postgres. Accessing `ctx.db` without storage
enabled throws with that enablement guidance. On the platform each app
gets its own schema + login role (search_path pinned, 10s
statement_timeout); credentials live in Supabase Vault. Session-scoped
scratch belongs in `ctx.state` (or the `remember`/`recall` builtins, now
in-memory per-session).

There is no Vector store anymore — `ctx.vector`, the `vector:` agent field,
the `@alexkroman1/aai/vector` subpath, and the platform-owned
`PINECONE_API_KEY` were all removed. If retrieval comes back it will be a
Supabase (pgvector) store following the same path as `ctx.db`: per-app
schema, platform-provisioned credentials in Vault.
`ctx.db` connects DIRECTLY from the guest: the app's own scoped Postgres
credentials (role/search_path pinned at provisioning) ride into the guest as
`DATABASE_URL` in the agent's boot env, and the bundle's runtime opens its
own connection — exactly as `aai dev` does with a project `.env`. The old
host-proxied `db/query` RPC is gone: it kept a versioned RPC in the
harness↔bundle contract to protect a credential that only reaches the
tenant's own data anyway.

## Guest network access

There is **no per-agent egress policy**. `allowedHosts` and its enforcement
stack (the SDK's `tool-egress`/`guest-fetch-policy` in-process guard, the
platform's Modal outbound-domain allowlist, `guest-egress.ts`) were removed:
the agent's own code runs in the guest with open egress, exactly as it does
under `aai dev`. The Modal container is the isolation boundary — a tenant
can reach the internet, not the platform. Tool code and providers `fetch`
directly.

**The network builtins follow one rule: screen only when there is no
container around us** (`builtinFetch` in `host/ssrf.ts`).

- **Contained** (a Modal Sandbox) → plain `pinnedFetch`, no SSRF screen. The
  screen guards nothing a tenant cannot bypass in one line, because their own
  tool code has open egress by design — so it constrains the *model*, not the
  author. The container is the boundary and it holds no PLATFORM credentials
  (`ctx.db`'s DATABASE_URL is the app's own scoped role).
- **Not contained** (`aai dev`, and the subprocess backend) → `safeFetch`.
  Here the host IS someone's machine: these same builtins run in the
  developer's own process, where a model-controlled URL can reach localhost,
  the LAN, or cloud metadata. That is the case the screen exists for.

Containment is **declared by the spawner**, never inferred by the guest:
`modal-sandbox.ts` sets `AAI_SANDBOX_CONTAINED=1` in the exec env and the
subprocess backend does not. "Am I a guest" and "am I contained" are
different questions — the subprocess backend runs a guest with no container
at all, so a guest-token sniff would open egress on a developer's laptop.
`ssrf.test.ts` pins that distinction.

The residual risk in a container is prompt injection steering the model at an
internal endpoint; accepted, because the sandbox has nothing internal worth
reaching and an author who wants that can already write it.

## Data flow

On the platform, the browser's session WebSocket connects DIRECTLY to the
agent's sandbox (`/session` on its Modal tunnel, discovered via the
`GET /:slug/client-config` broker) — "server" below means the process
running the runtime: the guest harness on the platform, the `aai dev`
server locally. Audio path depends on the session mode (see above):

- **S2S mode**: user speaks → browser captures PCM → WebSocket → server
  relays audio into a single AssemblyAI S2S socket → agentic loop (LLM +
  tools) runs service-side → synthesized audio streams back through the
  same socket → server forwards to browser → user can interrupt at any
  time (cancels the in-flight turn).
- **Pipeline mode**: user speaks → browser captures PCM → WebSocket →
  server forwards audio to the STT provider → STT partials stream to the
  client as `user_transcript_partial` (live captions) and drive
  `speech_started`/`speech_stopped` edges → the committed transcript fires
  `onUserTranscript` → host runs the LLM loop locally via `streamText`
  (tool calls execute on the host just like S2S mode) → assistant text
  chunks stream into the TTS provider → synthesized audio returns over
  the client WebSocket → interrupts cancel the in-flight LLM stream and
  TTS playback. A barge-in that never commits a user turn is treated as a
  false interruption and the reply resumes (see
  `falseInterruptionTimeoutMs`).

## Default values and magic numbers

All numeric constants live in `packages/aai/sdk/constants.ts` (client-audio
budgets are split into `sdk/client-audio-constants.ts` for file-length reasons
and re-exported from `constants.ts`, so the import path is unchanged). Key
defaults that affect agent behavior:

| Default | Value | Where applied | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `maxSteps` | 10 (`DEFAULT_MAX_STEPS`) | `constants.ts` | Max tool calls per reply. Prevents runaway tool loops; sized so multi-tool chains plus a repair retry fit. |
| `toolChoice` | `"auto"` | runtime resolution | LLM decides when to use tools vs respond directly. Full AI SDK set: `"auto"`, `"required"`, `"none"`, `{ type: "tool", toolName }`. |
| `idleTimeoutMs` | 300,000 (5 min) | `constants.ts:26` | `0` or non-finite disables the timer entirely. Re-armed on every inbound audio frame (`resetIdle`), so it measures silence, not call length. On expiry session-core emits `idle_timeout` **and closes the socket** — the event alone retires nothing (clients treat it as informational and wait for the close), so for a long time an idle session lingered and only Modal's 300s input cap reaped it. |
| `silenceTimeoutMs` | unset (disabled) | `pipeline-silence.ts` | Pipeline only: assistant proactively takes a turn after this much user silence. Capped at `MAX_CONSECUTIVE_SILENCE_NUDGES` (3) back-to-back nudges until the user speaks again. `silencePrompt` customizes the injected instruction (default `DEFAULT_SILENCE_PROMPT`); it is kept in LLM history but never emitted as a user transcript. |
| `minBargeInWords` | 2 (`DEFAULT_MIN_BARGE_IN_WORDS`) | `constants.ts` | Pipeline only: interim-transcript words before user speech interrupts the in-flight reply. 2 keeps one-word backchannels from cutting the agent off; sub-threshold finals are answered after the reply. |
| `interruptionMinDurationMs` | 500 (`DEFAULT_INTERRUPTION_MIN_DURATION_MS`) | `constants.ts` | Pipeline only: sustained speech (ms since the utterance's first partial) required before an interim-triggered barge-in fires — LiveKit's `min_interruption_duration` analog. Non-zero by default: room noise and echo of the agent's own voice produce short interim transcripts, and each one used to abandon a reply mid-word. Finals are never gated. 0 disables. |
| AssemblyAI `min_turn_silence` / `max_turn_silence` | 1000 / 3500 (`DEFAULT_MIN_TURN_SILENCE_MS`, `DEFAULT_MAX_TURN_SILENCE_MS`) | `host/providers/stt/assemblyai.ts` | **Two knobs, not one, and the pause-tolerance one is the MAX.** On Universal-3.5 Pro the minimum is when the model runs its end-of-turn CHECK: the turn ends only if it READS as complete, otherwise a partial is emitted and the turn stays open. The maximum force-ends regardless of content. So the minimum is the latency floor on every finished utterance, while the maximum is paid only by utterances that never read complete. Both are always sent, because the service defaults them independently (min from the `mode` preset — 128/128/800 for `min_latency`/`balanced`/`max_accuracy` — and max to **1536**), and sending only one is how they invert. That inversion is the bug this pair replaced: the minimum was raised 1500 -> 2000 -> 3000 chasing Full-Duplex-Bench v3's hesitation recording while the maximum was never set, so from 2000 on the check could not fire before the content-blind force-end at 1536 had closed the turn — every ending came from the acoustic fallback, which is the mechanism that splits utterances, and the 3000 step changed nothing while taxing every complete utterance ~3s. The 1000 floor is pinned by `pipeline-transport-options.test.ts`: the two knobs guard opposite splits, so the minimum must clear the pause BETWEEN two sentences (a multi-sentence utterance splits at the question mark otherwise, since sentence one reads complete) while the maximum clears the pause WITHIN one. That rules out the `max_accuracy` preset's 800. Note the max still EXCEEDS `DEFAULT_FALSE_INTERRUPTION_TIMEOUT_MS` (2000) though the min no longer does, so the recovery-window coupling survives in narrowed form — safe for the same reason, a fired window whose utterance is still open DEFERS the resume. Override via `assemblyAIStt({ minTurnSilenceMs, maxTurnSilenceMs })`. Three further knobs the SDK supports and we do not set: `mode`, `vad_threshold`, `interruption_delay`. |
| Deepgram `endpointing` | 1500 (`DEFAULT_DEEPGRAM_ENDPOINTING_MS`) | `sdk/providers/stt/deepgram.ts` | Same role as `min_turn_silence` above — the provider owns end-of-turn; override via `deepgram({ endpointing })`. |
| `holdPhrase` | `"One moment."` (`DEFAULT_HOLD_PHRASE`) | `pipeline-stream.ts` | Pipeline only: spoken when a turn opens with a tool call and no speech. `""` disables. |
| `errorPhrase` | `"Sorry, I had a problem just then. Could you say that again?"` (`DEFAULT_ERROR_PHRASE`) | `pipeline-turn-outcome.ts` | Pipeline only: spoken when the turn's LLM stream fails, so a provider outage hands the conversation back instead of going silent. A failed turn produces no text, so nothing would otherwise reach TTS and the only trace is a `llm` session error the browser surfaces without a sound. `""` disables. |
| dead-air cover | 5000 ms (`DEFAULT_DEAD_AIR_COVER_MS`) | `pipeline-stream.ts` | Pipeline only: tool execution that sends nothing to TTS for this long gets a `DEAD_AIR_COVER_PHRASES` filler — unlike `holdPhrase` this is time-based, so it still fires after the model has spoken, and repeats across a tool chain with the wait doubling each time. `holdPhrase: ""` disables both. **Must stay above the MEDIAN tool turn**: this is cover for the long-chain outlier, and at 2000 it sat under the ordinary case and fired on 93% of tool turns (EVA airline run, `pretoolspeech_rate` 0.933, tool turns averaging 6.24s), twice on the longest — converting a latency problem into `verbosity_or_filler_rate` 0.38 and `redundant_statements_rate` 0.60. **Cover phrases must also be purely declarative**, never a request for patience: filler goes into an open mic, so "Still working on that." drew "All right, I'll hold" from the caller, which barged in, and the agent was still answering it two turns later after the caller had said goodbye. |
| `falseInterruptionTimeoutMs` | 2000 (`DEFAULT_FALSE_INTERRUPTION_TIMEOUT_MS`) | `constants.ts` | Pipeline only: a partial-triggered barge-in that never commits a user turn (STT noise) resumes the interrupted reply via a synthetic continuation turn after this window. A mid-turn cut resumes from the `[interrupted]` history marker (`DEFAULT_FALSE_INTERRUPTION_PROMPT`); a cut during the client playback tail — the reply finished server-side but was still playing out — resumes with a prompt quoting the estimated last-heard words (`buildTailResumePrompt`), unless less than `TAIL_RESUME_MIN_UNHEARD_MS` of audio was unheard. 0 disables. |
| `maxHistory` | 200 | `constants.ts:52` | Sliding window of conversation messages retained. **The LLM view is trimmed by `capLlm`, not `cap`** (`pipeline-history.ts`): that view holds tool-call/result PAIRS, and an index trim can land between an assistant `tool-call` message and the `tool` message answering it. Both providers reject an unmatched tool result outright (OpenAI: "messages with role 'tool' must be a response to a preceding message with 'tool_calls'"), so every remaining turn of the call failed at the provider and the caller heard `errorPhrase` instead of a reply. Turn sizes vary — 2 messages for a text-only turn, 4 for one tool call, more for a chain — so the window drifts out of alignment with turn boundaries on its own; nothing about the conversation has to be unusual. Only the FRONT is trimmed, so dropping leading `tool` messages is sufficient. A uniform turn size hides the whole class: 4 divides 200, so every trim lands on a turn boundary. |
| resume grace | 120,000 (`SESSION_RESUME_GRACE_MS`) | `constants.ts` | How long a disconnected session's per-session tool state (`ctx.state`) survives awaiting a `?sessionId=<id>` resume — the runtime's stateMap sweep (in-guest on the platform, in-process under `aai dev`) waits it out, cancelled when the session resumes. Sized above the browser client's worst-case automatic-reconnect span (~105s); the client reconnects with the sessionId from the `config` frame, so the resumed session finds its state under the same key. |
| `builtinTools` | `DEFAULT_BUILTIN_TOOLS` (`think`, `remember`, `recall`, `calculate`) | `constants.ts` | Cognitive built-ins on by default: private reasoning scratchpad, session notes, safe calculator. Set `builtinTools` explicitly (including `[]`) to override. `web_search`/`visit_webpage`/`get_page_design`/`fetch_json`/`run_code` remain opt-in. A custom or relayed tool with the same name wins — the built-in is dropped. |

## Self-hosted server defaults (`aai/host/server.ts`)

`createServer` has no request authentication of its own — it is the `aai dev`
backend, not the managed platform. Two defaults exist because of that, and
both are fail-closed:

- **Binds loopback.** `listen(port, host = DEFAULT_LISTEN_HOST)` defaults to
  `127.0.0.1`. Pass `"0.0.0.0"` deliberately to expose it; binding every
  interface by default put a developer's agent (and the provider credentials
  behind it) in reach of anyone on the same network. `aai dev` exposes this as
  `AAI_DEV_HOST` for setups where loopback isn't reachable (e.g. running in a
  container and connecting from the host).
- **Host mode is opt-in.** A `?host=1` WebSocket lets the *client* supply the
  agent definition (`systemPrompt`, `greeting`, relayed tool schemas) while the
  session runs on the operator's credentials, so `isHostAllowed` requires an
  explicit `AAI_ALLOW_HOST` of `1`/`true`/`yes`/`on`. Unset means off.
  Harnesses (e.g. tau2) set it themselves. Note `resolveServerEnv` only
  surfaces keys declared in `.env`, so `aai dev` passes the shell value through
  explicitly (`hostModeEnv`) — otherwise exporting the variable the usual way
  would have no effect.

## Pipeline-transport interleaving fuzz

**`aai` has a randomized interleaving fuzz over the pipeline transport**
(`host/integration/pipeline-fuzz.integration.test.ts`, run by
`pnpm --filter @alexkroman1/aai test:integration`; needs no API keys). The
scripted specs in `host/transports/` each assert ONE interleaving; this drives
random event orderings and checks GLOBAL invariants — turn serialization, no
callback after `stop()`, no write to a closed provider session, reply-text
integrity, no audio after a reply's own `replyDone` — plus the strongest
oracle, validating every LLM request payload the way Anthropic and OpenAI do
(an unmatched `tool` result is a hard 400). That oracle is what surfaced the
`capLlm` bug above. Two rules when extending it: **an oracle must be a
property a real provider or client enforces**, and **the generator must not
itself break a provider contract** — an early draft emitted TTS audio at
arbitrary moments, and the truncation oracle fired on the generator rather
than the transport. It also asserts COVERAGE FLOORS (barge-in, tool
execution, history trimming, reply completion): an all-green fuzz proves
nothing if the random walk never entered the state, so a suddenly greener
result is usually a broken generator, not a fixed bug. Discovery and
regression are separate jobs — findings get a deterministic spec of their own
(the `capLlm` one lives in `pipeline-history.test.ts`), because whether a
random walk reaches a given alignment is luck. That is measured, not assumed:
reverting the `capLlm` fix leaves this suite GREEN (both before and after it
moved to fast-check) while `pipeline-history.test.ts` fails immediately. The
step count carries an unusual `minLength`, because a run spends its first
steps getting the session past `start()` and shorter scripts finish before a
reply ever completes.

- Its generated world (`_pipeline-fuzz-input.ts`) is split from the spec, and
  its request-payload validator from `_pipeline-fuzz-model.ts`, so the spec
  file is the ORACLES and the driver. Note biome's `noSecrets` rule is off for
  `**/_*-fuzz-*.ts` alongside test files (`biome.json`): a camelCase action
  name like `armBargeInFromTool` reads as high-entropy to it, and mangling a
  domain identifier to satisfy a false positive is the wrong trade.
- **Its fatality oracle needed a generator change to mean anything.** "Nothing
  conversational may reach a client that was told the session is over" passed
  on arrival — the fake LLM could not fail a turn, so the state was
  unreachable and the oracle decorative. The script pattern now carries a
  `fail` turn (an `error` stream part) and the instrumented `doStream`
  sometimes refuses outright, which are separate reporters; it then failed at
  once, on `onReplyDone`/`onSpeechStarted` after a fatal `llm` error. Hence
  the floors on `error:llm`, `llmRefused`, and `nonFatal:llm`: the first two
  keep the state reachable, the third turns a regression to `fatal` into a
  failure rather than a silent gap.

## S2S property test

**`aai` has a fast-check PROPERTY TEST over the S2S stack**
(`host/integration/s2s-fuzz.integration.test.ts` plus `_s2s-fuzz-model.ts`,
`_s2s-fuzz-harness.ts`, `_s2s-fuzz-commands.ts`; same command, also keyless).
It differs from the pipeline fuzz twice over — in what it composes, and in how
it generates.

- **The only fake is the SOCKET.** `connectS2s` (wire parse + dispatch),
  `createS2sTransport` (resume, tool-result redelivery, audio suppression) and
  `createSessionCore` (turn lifecycle, tool execution) all run for real, with
  a recording `ClientSink` at the far end. That is the point: every S2S spec that
  predates it stubs out a neighbouring layer (the transport specs mock
  `connectS2s`, the wire specs mock the callbacks), and all three bugs it found
  live in the seam BETWEEN layers, with every layer's own suite green.
- **Model-based COMMANDS, where the pipeline fuzz generates a script.** Both
  are fast-check; the difference is that legality here lives in each command's
  `check()` against a model that IS the provider state machine, so an illegal
  frame is never generated (no audio outside a reply, no `reply.started` while
  the service awaits a `tool.result`) and a counterexample contains only the
  commands that ran. Reverting each of the three fixes reproduces it from
  `[session.error(rate_limited)]`, `[drop.transient, openSocket,
  session.error(session_not_found)]`, and `[drop.transient]` — one, three, and
  one command.
- **No timers anywhere.** Socket opening and tool settlement are COMMANDS, so
  when a tool settles relative to a drop is part of the generated plan rather
  than a race. That is what makes shrinking and replay mean anything: this
  suite's own first draft awaited real `setTimeout`s, could not re-run its
  counterexamples, and intermittently reported a finding no rerun could
  reproduce. It is also why it runs in ~150ms rather than ~50s — the
  per-command drain is a `setImmediate`, not a ~1ms timer.
- **Three properties, differentiated by a per-run `faultBudget`** (0 / 2 / 3):
  turns, reconnects, retirement. One combined property cannot serve both ends
  — at 2 faults per 40 commands a tool call rarely survived to be answered (the
  central oracle ran 7 times out of 80 executions), and at 0 there are no
  resumes to redeliver across.
- Oracles: a tool call the service issued gets exactly one `tool.result` (zero
  leaves the service holding a turn it can never continue — the user hears an
  agent go silent until the idle timeout); nothing conversational reaches a
  client that was told the session is over; at most one fatal `connection`
  error per session, and no socket opened after it; no socket left open after
  `stop()`; `session.resume` only ever names an id the service issued. The
  streaming ones live in the harness's sink and THROW, so fast-check shrinks;
  the end-of-run ones run before `stop()`, which legitimately abandons work.
- **A resumed session inherits the dead socket's unanswered tool calls** —
  that is what `session.resume` MEANS, and it is the premise the tool-answer
  oracle rests on. Stop modelling it and the oracle stops meaning anything.
- **A finding is only reachable if the run does not excuse it first.** The
  tool-answer exemptions (interrupted turn, client reset, retired session, link
  not ready, a SIBLING call of the same reply still running — results flush per
  reply as a BATCH) are broad enough to silence the oracle completely, so each
  increments a `skip:<why>` counter and the floors are on the CHECKED counts.
  `toolAnsweredAcrossResume` has been near zero through three separate
  mistakes; it is the floor that stands between a live oracle and a decorative
  one. `S2S_FUZZ_COVERAGE=1` prints the table.
- **The fakes' fidelity is where the false findings came from**, every time.
  Three drafts blamed the transport for behaviour their own fake had invented:
  a `executeTool` that ignored its abort signal (the real one settles promptly
  via `pTimeout({ signal })`, so `stop()` was reported as hanging forever), one
  that ignored an ALREADY-aborted signal (which is exactly what a `tool.call`
  after a client cancel receives, since `onCancel` aborts the reply without
  replacing it), and one that rejected where the real executor always RESOLVES
  with a `toolError(...)` string. Check the real collaborator's contract before
  believing a finding.

## Fixture replay testing (`host/`)

Tests in `packages/aai/host/` use a **hybrid mock** pattern: a real
`Runtime` and tool executor with mocked S2S WebSocket connections. JSON
fixtures in `host/fixtures/` contain recorded AssemblyAI API messages
that are replayed through the real orchestration layer. Key helpers:

- `makeMockHandle()` — creates mock S2S WebSocket using nanoevents
- `replayFixtureMessages()` — dispatches fixture JSON as typed events
- `createFixtureSession()` — wires a real Runtime to mocked S2S

## One canonical config schema, deny-list boundaries

**One canonical config schema, deny-list boundaries.** The dropped-field bug
family (`builtinTools` — deployed agents silently lost the default cognitive
builtins; `send`; the provider triple) all came from
allow-list mappers re-declaring the config field list, where every field is
optional and an omission is valid TypeScript. Every such bug presents as a
*working* agent quietly ignoring part of its own config. The design is now
inverted — one canonical serializable schema flows CLI → server → runtime
unchanged, and each boundary subtracts an explicit deny-list instead of
copying fields:

- **`AgentConfigSchema`** (`sdk/_internal-types.ts`) is the canonical shape.
  `toAgentConfig` strips `HOST_ONLY_AGENT_FIELDS` (`tools`, `state`) plus
  undefined values and validates through the schema — no per-field copies.
  `_internal-types.test.ts` asserts the one subtraction:
  `Exclude<keyof AgentDef, keyof AgentConfig | HostOnlyAgentField>` is `never`.
- **`agent()`** derives its parameter shape from `AgentDef`
  (`AgentParams` = `Omit` + `Partial<Pick>` of the defaulted fields) plus
  three author-only conveniences `agent()` normalizes away (`system` as an
  alias of `systemPrompt`, `llm` accepting a gateway model-id string —
  `sdk/providers/llm/from-string.ts` — and `voice` desugaring to
  `tts: assemblyAITts({ voice })`), instead
  of re-declaring it inline — the inline form is how `send` and `state`
  shipped as runtime-working but excess-property errors for authors
  (neither bundler typechecks user code). `define.test-d.ts` locks this.
- **`IsolateConfigSchema`** (`aai-server/rpc-schemas.ts`) is
  `AgentConfigSchema.extend({...})` — the extensions are wire-tolerance
  loosenings, wire defaults, and the wire-only `toolSchemas`; none may drop
  a field. It runs at **deploy time only** (`validateAgentConfig`), on the
  current CLI's freshly extracted config.
- **Stored configs are FULLY OPAQUE on reads** (`StoredAgentConfigSchema` in
  `aai-server/agent-store.ts` — a bare record): the host has NO field-level
  reader left. Even the broker's `name`/`greeting` are PROXIED from the
  guest's own `/client-config` (the bundle's live agent definition,
  interpreted by the bundle's own SDK — see client-config-handler.ts), so a
  platform schema change can never re-interpret a deployed agent. A stored
  config is never re-validated against a newer schema, so tightening
  `IsolateConfigSchema` cannot 404 previously-valid deployed agents.
  Never add fields or refinements to the stored schema — strictness belongs
  at the deploy boundary.
- **The server never maps a stored config onto a runtime agent.** The old
  `toRuntimeAgent` boundary (`sandbox-agent-config.ts`) is gone with platform
  host mode — sessions run the bundle's own SDK on the bundle's own agent
  definition, so there is no server-side config→agent mapping left to drop
  fields at. (Historical context, kept because the bug class recurs: provider
  descriptors must be keyed off their own presence, never the optional
  `config.mode` — a config carrying all three providers with no `mode` once
  hit a `config.mode === "pipeline"` gate and lost every one of them, so the
  runtime resolved S2S and ran a healthy S2S session on the agent's own key,
  nothing logged. `superRefine` still rejects a `mode` that disagrees with
  the descriptors.) `rpc-schemas.test.ts` asserts the remaining subtraction:
  `Exclude<keyof AgentConfig, keyof IsolateConfig>` is `never`.

A new serializable agent field therefore needs exactly two edits — `AgentDef`
(docs + type) and `AgentConfigSchema` (shape) — and the type guards fail
loudly if either half is missing; no mapper edits, and the field reaches the
server, the wire, and the runtime by default.

**Never let S2S be a fallback.** The pipeline-by-default flip closed most of
this structurally: a config that loses its providers now gets the AssemblyAI
pipeline injected (`defaultProviders`), not a silent S2S session, and S2S
requires an explicit `s2s` descriptor. There is no fallthrough left —
`buildTransport` (`host/runtime-transport.ts`) throws on a descriptor-less
config whose pipeline providers didn't resolve (the pre-flip legacy fallback
to `buildAssemblyS2sTransport` was removed). Two rules keep mode
diagnosable: forward providers based on their own presence (above), and
`createRuntime` logs `"Session mode resolved"` once per runtime with the mode
and provider kinds — "which transport is this agent on" must be answerable
from one log line rather than inferred from the shape of the message stream
(`S2S <<` prefixes).
