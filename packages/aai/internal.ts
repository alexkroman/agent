 * `@alexkroman1/aai/internal` — infrastructure shared with the sibling
 * packages (`aai-ui`, `aai-server`, …), NOT part of the public SDK API and
 * not covered by semver. Agents and client code should never import from
 * here; everything an `agent.ts` or `client.tsx` needs lives on the root
 * export and the documented subpaths.
 *
 * These modules used to ride on the root barrel, where they drowned the
 * four-symbol authoring API (`agent`, `tool`, `assemblyAIPipeline`,
 * `assemblyAIS2s`) in autocomplete noise. Keeping them on their own subpath
 * keeps the root importable surface honest.
 *
 * Named re-exports rather than `export *`: the wildcard form needs a
 * `noReExportAll` suppression, and the escape-hatch ratchet only moves down.
