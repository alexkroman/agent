### Major Changes

- b8a5529: **BREAKING — 31 names move off `@alexkroman1/aai-runtime`'s root barrel to
  `@alexkroman1/aai-runtime/internal`.**
  
  Every one is a re-export of `@alexkroman1/aai/host-internal`, which the SDK
  itself deny-lists from its contracted surface as "not semver-covered". That
  exemption is per SUBPATH, so re-publishing the names on this package's root
  barrel defeated it — fifty not-semver-covered names sat on the one surface an
  embedder autocompletes over, one package along, and no contract could cover them
  without promising epochs on the SDK's internals.
  
  A release tag cannot fix it from here: API Extractor reads `@internal` at the
  DECLARATION site, so a `/** @internal */` on a re-export clause member is
  silently ignored (verified — the name stayed `@public` in the regenerated
  report). A subpath is the mechanism, and `NON_AUTHORING_SUBPATHS` now names this
  one so a name arriving there joins no capability contract.
  
  What moved: the builtins resolver, the SSRF-safe fetch pair, the four step-slot
  publishers, and the upload byte constants and id grammar. `aai-server`,
  `aai-cli` and `aai-guest` import them from the new subpath — the cross-package
  consumers the seam exists for.
  
  The 17-name OPENER CONTRACT deliberately did NOT move. `registerSttKind`/
  `registerTtsKind` are on the root barrel, and relocating their parameter types
  would make a custom speech provider — the documented use — import from two
  subpaths, one labelled not-semver-covered.
  
  Two dead mocks came out with it, both of which had stopped covering anything
  while every spec kept passing: `aai-guest`'s `vi.mock("@alexkroman1/aai-runtime")`
  replacing `safeFetch` (the import had moved, so the real function ran), and the
  CLI dev-server factory's `publishStepEnv`.

### Patch Changes

- d98169a: **Breaking (nominally): `@alexkroman1/aai-ui/default-client/*` is removed.** It
  had no consumer in any form — not one import specifier in the repo, the
  templates, the scaffold, or any README — because every real consumer reaches
  those files by filesystem path through `./package.json` (`client-dir.ts`,
  `aai-server/transport-websocket.ts`). `files: ["dist"]` still ships them, so
  nothing that worked stops working. `aai-studio-client`'s `./dist/*` goes for the
  same reason: both of its consumers `require.resolve` the manifest and join
  `"dist"` themselves.
  
  Also widens `check:attw`. `aai-ui` pinned `--entrypoints .`, which silently
  excluded `./client-dir` — a typed, contracted subpath — and `aai-runtime`
  inherited the same pin. `aai-ui` now uses `--exclude-entrypoints styles.css`
  (a CSS entry point has no type declarations, which is the only reason the pin
  existed) and `aai-runtime` drops it entirely, so a NEW subpath defaults into
  being checked instead of out.
- b8a5529: Version `@alexkroman1/aai-runtime`'s published surface in epochs, like `aai` and
  `aai-ui`. Twelve capabilities — `server`, `runtime`, `session`, `session-state`,
  `providers`, `telephony`, `uploads`, `db`, `keys`, `workflow`, `logging`,
  `text` — partition all 122 public names, each with a committed epoch and a
  frozen, compiling authoring example. `pnpm check:api-contracts` now reports 42
  contracts across 3 packages.
  
  The split shipped a published package with no `contracts/` tree, so 221 exports
  could move with nothing recording it while its two siblings could not change a
  parameter without a gate asking which. `contracts/internal-surface.json` opens
  at 68 and may only shrink — the ratchet that took `aai` from 74 to 0.
  
  Two gate-test parsers had never seen shapes this package introduces, and both
  reported a healthy tree as broken. A capability whose every name is a type
  collapses to `export type { … } from` under Biome, which
  `api-contracts-gate.test.ts` read as "declares something of its own" — so
  `session` and `session-state`, the two most obviously correct roots, failed. And
  an entry point can be ALL re-export (`/internal` passes on 31 names and declares
  nothing), which `api-surface-file.test.ts` read as an empty report —
  indistinguishable there from a parser that stopped working. The gate tests also
  pin the three-way `:workflow` ambiguity now, plus `:session` and `:uploads`,
  which is what makes the CLI's refusal to guess load-bearing.
