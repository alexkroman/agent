## 0.0.5

### Patch Changes

- 5cda7c5: Add ctx.send for real-time tool-to-client events

  Tools can now push arbitrary events to the browser client via `ctx.send(event, data)`. Events flow over the existing WebSocket as `custom_event` messages. The new `useEvent` React hook subscribes to named events. Migrated solo-rpg, pizza-ordering, dispatch-center, and night-owl templates from `useToolResult` to `ctx.send` + `useEvent`.

## 0.0.2

### Patch Changes

- 50cd113: Fix scaffold missing client.tsx and route pnpm install through safe-chain

  - Add client.tsx to scaffold with correct `client` import from aai-ui (fixes build failure from stale `defineClient` reference)
  - Detect safe-chain on PATH and route pnpm install through it with `--safe-chain-skip-minimum-package-age` to avoid blocking newly published packages
