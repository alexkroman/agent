# packages/aai-templates — templates guide

Agent templates + the project scaffold (private package). Note
`scaffold/CLAUDE.md` is a PRODUCT artifact — it is scaffolded into every
`aai init` project and embedded in the studio system prompt — not
documentation for this repo.

## Templates

- `packages/aai-templates/templates/` contains agent
  scaffolding templates (simple, web-researcher, etc.). Each is
  self-contained with its own `agent.ts` and optional `client.tsx`.
  `scaffold/` has base project files (package.json, tsconfig,
  etc.) layered underneath.

  **They ship inside the `@alexkroman1/aai-cli` tarball**, copied into its
  `dist/` at build time by `aai-cli/bundle-templates.mjs` — the sources stay
  in `aai-templates`, which still owns their tests, typecheck, and lint;
  this is packaging, not a move. `aai init` used to fetch them at run time
  with giget (`github:alexkroman/agent/packages/aai-templates#main`), which
  required a network for every init and pinned templates to `main`
  regardless of the CLI version installed, so a template written against a
  newer SDK could land in a project resolving an older one. Two consequences
  worth knowing:
  - `packages/aai-cli/turbo.json` adds the template sources to the build's
    `inputs`. They live in another package, so the root task's
    package-relative globs cannot see them — without the override, editing a
    template replays a cached CLI build that predates it.
  - Nothing running in-tree can exercise the shipped path: `getMonorepoRoot()`
    keys off the module's own location, so a CLI built at
    `packages/aai-cli/dist` always finds the workspace root and takes the
    monorepo branch. The e2e suite's `detachedCli()` copies `dist/` somewhere
    with no `pnpm-workspace.yaml` above it for that reason, and `aaiEnv()`
    deliberately sets no `AAI_TEMPLATES_DIR` — that override used to pin
    every e2e run to the workspace sources.
