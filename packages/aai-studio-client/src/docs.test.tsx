// The API pane: this project's own HTTP surface, read from the running agent.
//
// What matters here is that the workflow half is GENERATED rather than written
// — the request bodies carry the field names the deployed agent declares, so a
// snippet is current by construction — that it reads the AGENT's brokered API
// rather than a studio route, that it falls back to the preview agent and says
// so, and that the carrier webhook URLs live on this pane now (they are how
// something CALLS this agent, which is this pane's subject).
